The defective gene Dystrophin  causes an muscle wasting progresses as the patients geting older untill finally respiratory or cardiac failure develops. Prevalence in Germany amount 100 male newborns / year. Nearly all patients with DMD are diagnosed at preschool age and become wheelchair-bound between 13-15 years. Cardiomyopathy develops in the second decade of life resulting in left ventricular dysfunction.  Incidence of dilated cardiomyopathy increases  with age, up to 57% of DMD patients older than 18 years are suffering under noticeable cardiac insufficiency. <br/><br/>Due to better medical care and home ventilation therapy the life expectancy of DMD-patients has increased in the last three decades, and cardiac failure due to cardiomyopathy increasingly becomes a reason for mortality and morbidity in these patients. <br/><br/>ACE-Inhibitor und Beta-Blocker are established medication used for treatment at cardiac insufficiency  mostly at the adult-Patients. The past clinical trials showed already improvement of cardiac dysfunction as also prolongation of Life of Patient who have been taken this medication. There are also a few small studies witch show the same positiv results by children. <br/>It is still an unresolved question if an early prophylactic treatment with a combined ACE-inhibitor/beta-blocker therapy according to modern guidelines in cardiology can delay the onset of left ventricular dysfunction and contribute to a longer survival and better quality of life of DMD patients. A placebo controlled multi-centre trial will assess the effectiveness of preventive treatment with a combination of ACE-inhibitor and beta-blocker.;ACE-inhibitors and beta-blockers are used as treatment for heart failure in Duchenne muscular dystrophy. So far, there is only evidence for this drug therapy in cardiomyopathy of other etiology such as dilative cardiomyopathy, alcohol-toxic or ischemic heart disease in adults. Only few studies of low evidence exist suggesting that ACE-inhibitors and beta-blockers are effective in Duchenne cardiomyopathy. This project wants to test the hypothesis that prophylactic anticongestive therapy can delay or avoid manifestation of Duchenne cardiomyopathy. <br/>N=130 patients with Duchenne Muscular with normal left ventricular function (LVSF > =30%) aged 10-14 years will be included into the study and followed  in half-yearly intervals for max. 6 years until left ventricular dysfunction (defined by fraction shortening < 28%) becomes apparent. Time to left ventricular dysfunction will be analyzed in a proportional hazards regression model with treatment assignment and study centre as covariates. <br/>History including symptoms, side effects, concomitant medication, intercurrent diseases and quality of life will be documented together with vital parameters and a standard-10-channel-ECG. At each visit, medication will be handed out according to weight class. For efficacy assessment, fraction shortening will be measured by echocardiography. Tissue Doppler Imaging will be used where available as secondary outcome measure. A yearly safety-lab and a 24-h-ECG will check on safety and tolerability, neurohumeral mediators (Noradrenalin, Aldosteron, Angiotensin II, Renin, pro-BNP) will be done three times during the study. In case of positive study results, further studies to confirm therapeutic benefit will follow. Tissue Doppler Imaging will be evaluated in comparison to 2D echocardiography.<br/>According to Amendment 01 of 12.

Mechanical ventilation, however, cause mechanical alterations of pulmonary cells and may induce additional lung injury and aggravate respiratory failure. ACE-inhibitors are pharmacological compounds that are broadly used in vascular and cardiac medicine and have been proven to protect the heart and kidneys.  There are experimental studies that demonstrate a beneficial and protective effect of ACE inhibitors on lung cells. This study investigates, whether the administration of an ACE inhibitor is a safe intervention in ventilated patients with respiratory failure.<br/>The following changes were reported with the amendment from 9.10.2013:<br/>- inclusion criteria "" ...onset of ventilation not longer than 48h ago"" increased to ""...onset of ventilation not longer than 60h ago""<br/>- inclusion criteria ""age 18-80 years"" changed into "" age not less than18 years""<br/>- exclusion criteria: ""Patients after bone marrow- or stem cell transplant limited to ""...during the last 12 months""<br/>The following changes were reported with the amendment from 05.02.2015:<br/>- projected sample size of 210 patients reduced to 60 patients in consultation with the data monitoring committee (DMC) due to delay of recruitment.<br/>- further secondary endpoint: change of kidney function until day 28 based on serum creatinine";Alveolar overdistension is an important pathogenetic mechanism in ventilator induced lung injury leading to alveolar epithelial cell apoptosis and aggravating acute lung injury (ALI.) Protective ventilatory strategies (low tidal volume) have improved the outcome of ALI/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). However, it remains a problem that in ALI/ARDS unknown proportions of the lung exhibit low compliance (baby lung effect). Thus, alveolar overdistension may occur, despite the use of low tidal volume ventilation. So far, there is no established pharmacological treatment of ALI/ARDS. No pharma¬cological intervention that increases the tolerance of pulmonary parenchyma to overdistension exists. Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) inhibitors prevent alveolar epithelial cell apoptosis in several models including mechanical stretch-induced apoptosis. A polymorphism of the ACE gene resulting in increased ACE activity correlates with an in-creased incidence and a poor prognosis of ALI/ARDS. The ACEmeVENT-Pilot is a randomised, double blind, placebo controlled, multi-centre study that will investigate treatment with ACE inhibition in ventilated patients with ALI/ARDS. A total of 210 patients will be randomised to continuous i.v. administration of the ACE inhibitor Enalaprilat with a maximum dose of 10 mg/d or placebo in addition to standard treatment.

For a long time now drugs known as ""typical"" (conventional) antipsychotics have been available on the market. In recent years however developments referred to as ""atypical"" antipsychotics have become an alternative. The prevailing opinion in the psychiatric field is that these newer antipsychotic drugs are superior regarding effectiveness and tolerance. <br/>Their general superiority to the conventional drugs could not be clearly shown yet. Some clinical trials did not even find a relevant difference between specific typical and atypical drugs. Conclusive clinical trials are missing which meet the variety of the disease pattern, give sufficient choices of treatment possibilities, cover assessment of patient related outcomes and include a wide range of patients.<br/>This randomized, controlled and double blind project should answer open questions. It's innovative qualities are the comparison of different therapeutic strategies (""typical vs. atypical""), an improved biometrical design, a clinically relevant objective and criteria to include or exclude patients close to clinical reality. To take into account the individual characteristics of a patient the attending psychiatrist can make a limited choice of treatment. Another innovation is to determine the serum concentration of the study drug twice in order to gain more reliable information about the actual amount of agent in the patient's blood. <br/>This approach might also serve as model for other clinical trials with similar subjects.";"There is agreement in the psychiatry community that the so-called atypical antipsychotics should be considered first choice in the treatment of schizophrenic disorders (DGPPN 2005). However, the general superiority of these newer antipsychotic drugs over the older conventional drugs could not be clearly demonstrated in recent controlled clinical trials. The discrepancy between every day´s clinical perception and the results of clinical trials raises the question whether the studies performed so far employed the adequate methodological approach to represent the daily practice situation which is characterized by a wide variety of duration and type of the schizophrenic disorder, concomitant diseases, and medications. Moreover, some studies might not have been focused adequately on patient-relevant outcome variables. <br/>The present study project is designed to answer these open questions. The innovative character of the study design is <br/>1) that different neuroleptic strategies will be compared rather than single antipsychotic drugs, using <br/>2) an enhanced biometric design, that provides a choice of treatment with respect to the individual patient though the trial as such is randomised controlled and double blind; <br/>3) that clinically relevant endpoints such as quality of life will be the primary variables, and <br/>4) inclusion and exclusion criteria lead to a study population representing clinical every day practice as near as possible. <br/>Another innovatory procedure is that serum levels of the study drugs will be recorded twice during the study.

This disorder is the most common eating disorder, occurs in both sexes and is frequently associated with overweight and obesity. While studies have shown that binge eating disorder in adults can effectively be treated by psychotherapy, evidence for adolescents is largely lacking. For adults with binge eating disorder, cognitive-behavioral therapy is the standard psychological treatment.<br/>In this single-center randomized-controlled trial, the efficacy of a cognitive-behavioral treatment program tailored to adolescents with binge eating disorder is evaluated. Building on evidence-based cognitive-behavioral therapy for adults with binge eating disorder, the program adapted to adolescents aims at establishing healthy eating behaviors that prevent binge eating episodes from occurring and contribute to a stabilization of body weight. Further goals are the development of a positive body image and self-acceptance. Strategies for coping with negative emotions and problem-solving in everyday life are acquired. In addition, the transfer of the learned behaviors into daily routine is supported.<br/>After baseline diagnostics, 60 study participants will be randomized to one of two treatment conditions. Half the participants will immediately start with cognitive-behavioral therapy, the other half will start with therapy after a four-month waiting period. The treatment program includes 20 individual sessions with the adolescent over four months. Additionally, parents are involved in the treatment via coaching. For all participants of both treatment conditions, comprehensive individual diagnostics are conducted at baseline (and for the delayed treatment control condition additionally two months prior to treatment and at the beginning of treatment), mid-treatment, post-treatment, six-months, and 12-months follow-up. It is expected that cognitive-behavioral therapy will significantly reduce binge eating days when compared to the delayed treatment control condition. It is further expected that the specific eating disorder psychopathology, general psychopathology, body weight, quality of life, and self-esteem will be significantly improved.<br/>Positive evaluation of an amendment concernig an increased number of trial participants on 04.06.2014.;"Recent research indicates that binge eating is a common and clinically significant condition in youth. About 20-35% adolescents in treatment for overweight suffer from binge eating, and up to 25% present with a full-syndrome binge eating disorder (BED). Binge eating is associated with increased eating disorder and general psychopathology and an increased risk for overweight and obesity. <br/>Controlled studies of CBT generally report substantial reductions in binge eating and most associated problems like comorbid psychopathology and impaired quality of life.<br/>By now, however, there are no treatments available for binge eating in adolescents. Therefore, the goal of this research project is to evaluate in adolescents with BED efficacy of a cognitive-behavioral treatment (CBT) manual – the gold-standard treatment for adults with BED.<br/>In a single-center randomized-controlled efficacy trial, 60 adolescents meeting the DSM-IV-TR criteria of BED will be randomized to CBT (start of treatment after randomization) or a waiting-list (WL) (start of treatment 4 month after randomization) control condition. The individual outpatient treatment for adolescents with BED lasts 4 months and will be comprised of 20 sessions. The manual comprises the following phases: (1) Initial treatment phase for motivational enhancement; (2) Intensive treatment phase including modules on eating behavior, body image, and emotion regulation; (3) Self-management phase for relapse prevention. Patients will prospectively be assessed at baseline (additional assessments for WL: 2 months and directly before start treatment), mid-treatment, post-treatment, six-months and twelve-months follow-up after end of treatment. Results from the planned trial will contribute to the implementation of effective evidence-based treatment of adolescent binge eating in order to prevent excessive weight gain. This clinical trial is based on the hypothesis that because of CBT the number of days with BED can be reduced definitely in comparison to the waiting-list.";Recruiting complete, follow-up complete;Trial results;[---]*;https://www.karger.com/Article/FullText/503116;Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy for Adolescents with an Age-Adapted Diagnosis of Binge-Eating Disorder: A Randomized Clinical Trial;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;http://www.drks.de//drks_web/navigate.do?navigationId=trial.HTML&TRIAL_ID=DRKS00000542;2020-02-07T10:10:42.552+01:00;;Leipzig;FALSE;

Although the TE-UPPP is a widespread  surgical technique  there are still open questions regarding the effectiveness of the treatment.<br/>To investigate this effectiveness a randomized controlled trial will be performed. A baseline sleep examination using Polysomnography (PSG) is undertaken and subjective measures are recorded using questionnaires. One group of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients is then receiving TE-UPPP and one group is used as a non-treated control. After 3 month an additional PSG is performed and the questionnaires are answered again.;For therapy of the obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) syndrome there are many treatment options including conservative and surgical approaches. A possible surgical approach is tonsillectomy in combination with Uvulapalatopharyngoplasty (TE-UPPP). This classic intervention is used since 1981 in various modification to treat OSA. Excess mucosa at the soft palate and the uvula is resected and the whole soft palate is tightened. Although this form of therapy is used for approx. 30 years, only a limited number of prospective, randomized trials concerning the outcome of this therapy are available. Therefore the effectiveness can't be definitely assessed. The aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness of the TE-UPPP in a prospective, randomized study.<br/>At first a baseline sleep examination using Polysomnography (PSG) is performed. Additional parameters are assessed with questionnaires. One group of OSA patients is then receiving TE-UPPP and the other is used as a non-treated control.

The aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy, safety, reliability of this procedure, its influence on the healing of the skin, and the consumption of additional drugs such as Cortisone in relation to the use of immunoadsorption. <br/>In addition information about direct and indirect cost of the disease and quality of life in pemphigus patients will be collected.<br/>In pemphigus disease, the cellular defense system (immune system) attacks itself (autoimmune reaction). The mechanisms that normally remove exogenous substances (e.g. pathogens) are now attacking the body's own structures. As part of the immune response proteins are generated: the antibodies. These antibodies recognize specific cells or pathogens and cause their destruction. If antibodies as in pemphigus attack the body's own cells they are called autoantibodies.<br/>In pemphigus vulgaris, these autoantibodies are directed against cell structures in the upper skin layer (epidermis). Cells in the normally solid network of the skin cells in the epidermis are breaking apart (acantholysis). The skin loses mechanical stability and gets easily tearable. Blisters can form (Pemphix: Greek blister). The cause for this disease is so far not known. Probably a genetic predispositon to develop pemphigus is hereditable.<br/>In contrast to the most other autoimmune diseases (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis or multiple sclerosis) pemphigus autoantibodies are directly pathogenic. This was clearly shown in numerous studies in cell culture and in animal experiments. So it seems appropriate to remove these pathogenic pemphigus autoantibodies from the blood of the patients. For this purpose various procedures including immunoadsorption were used in the past 10 years. To date more than 1,000 immunoabsorption treatments in pemphigus have been carried out. This study will investigate if adjuvant immunoadsorption for the treatment of pemphigus is superior to drug treatment.<br/>;"Aim of the IA-Pem study is to investigate if adjuvant immunoadsorption is superior to standard immunosuppressive treatment in inducing clinical remission in pemphigus. The primary outcome measure (and most relevant clinical aim in the treatment of pemphigus) is time to clinical remission defined as healing of all blistering and erosive lesions. Healing of the initial lesions determines tapering of systemic corticosteroids (which are the major cause of severe side effects) and later on of adjuvant immunosuppressants. Clinical remission is the most relevant therapeutical goal for pemphigus patients who are severely disabled by lesions of the oral mucosa and the skin, respectively. <br/><br/>Although there is no generally accepted therapeutic standard, most dermatologists agree that tapering doses of prednisolone plus another immunosuppressant such as azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil / - sodium is the generally accepted first-line therapy of pemphigus in Central Europe and the US.<br/>Patients in arm 1 (BMT- best medical treatment - group) will receive Prednisolone at an initial dose of 1.0 mg/kg/d plus<br/>Azathioprine (1.5-2.5 mg/kg/d; according to serum TPMT activity) or <br/>Mycophenolate mofetil or Mycophenolate sodium (in case of intolerance to azathioprine).<br/>Evidence has accumulated from multiple monocenter uncontrolled trials that IA is effective in pemphigus. To finally demonstrate that immunoadsorption is an effective, corticosteroid-sparing, and safe adjuvant treatment for pemphigus, a prospective controlled study is required. The pathogenic role of autoAb against desmoglein 1 and 3 has been clearly established. The removal of serum autoAb is therefore a rational treatment option.<br/>Patients in Arm 2 (BMT+IA -Immunoadsorption - group) are in addition to medication treated with immunoadsorption on four consecutive days (= 1 treatment cycle) or if not possible at least within 6 days using Immunosorba® (Fresenius Medical Care). A total of two to four cycles will be performed in three-week intervals.<br/>The study will follow a randomised, prospective, multi-center, parallel-group study design to compare adjuvant immunoadsorption to standard immunosuppressive treatment in pemphigus. About 26 centers in Germany will take part in this study and 82 patients are needed for the final analysis. The recruitment period will be 24 months.

It is important to investigate, whether new methods can be transferred from controlled trials into the less structured setting of routine clinical care, and whether the health care system benefits from such developments.<br/>Therapists will be randomly assigned to either a training group in which the treatment approach will be delivered or a treatment as usual group (standard treatment). The inclusion of 105 patients suffering from social anxiety is intended. The treatment is designed for a time limited approach with 25 + 5 individual sessions of STPP over 6 month (STPP of 25 sessions as reimbursed by German health insurance). <br/>Before treatment starts, patients complaints and life situation will be assessed in detail by interview and standardized questionnaires. Diagnostic interviews will be conducted by the trial sites. Patients will be assessed by questionnaires 8 and 15 weeks after treatment start, directly at, as well as 6 month after end of treatment. After 25 session of treatment and twelve months after end of treatment, patients are invited for detailed assessment. <br/>The research questions are:<br/>(1) How can manualized STPP for Social Phobia be implemented into routine outpatient care?<br/>(2) Will the new methods lead to an improvement of treatment courses and outcomes?<br/>(3) Will treatment effects reached in routine psychotherapeutic treatments be comparable to those of the controlled, strictly manualized treatment of the main study?;There has been a lack of studies on the transfer of manualized treatments to routine psychodynamic practice. Our study is the first one to examine the effects of additional training in a manualized Short Term Psychodynamic Psychotherapy (STPP based on Supportive Expressive Therapy, SET) procedure on outcome in routine psychotherapy for Social Phobia. As an extension to the large multi-site RCT (N=512) in which Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and STPP for Social Phobia have been evaluated, we will investigate how the treatment can be transferred from controlled trials into the less structured setting of routine clinical care, and whether the health care system benefits from such developments. This question represents Phase IV of psychotherapy research. It combines the benefits of randomized controlled trials (efficacy studies) and naturalistic studies (effectiveness research). Private practitioners will be randomized to one of two treatment conditions (training in manualized STPP vs. treatment as usual without a specific training). We plan to enrol 105 patients (84 completers). The study is genuinely designed to promote faster and more widespread dissemination of effective interventions. The research questions are: (1) How can manualized STPP for Social Phobia be implemented into routine outpatient care?

MTX is given either alone or in combination with different cytostatic drugs, which can reach the brain. In up to 80% of the patients the lymphoma disappears under treatment. But in most of the patients it appears again. Radiation therapy of the brain after chemotherapy reduces the risk of relapse. But, especially in patients older than 60 years, it can reduce the function of the brain as a side effect. In this study the efficacy of a MTX-based therapy in patients with PCNSL older than 65 years is analyzed. High dose MTX is combined with two cytostatics, procarbacine and lomustine. These drugs can reach the cns and are given orally. In addition to the cytostatic treatment the antibody rituximab is given which recognizes typical proteins at the surface of the lymphoma cells. Following the treatment, a 6-month consolidation therapy with procarbacine orally is added for 5 days every 4 weeks. ;The most important part of the treatment of primary cns lymphoma (PCNSL) is highdose methotrexate (MTX). It is given either alone of in combination with other cytostatics which can reach the cns compartment. Although remission rates up to 80 % are reached, most of the patients relapse. Subsequent whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) can elevate remission rates but it also, especially in patients older than 60 years, can cause severe leukencephalopathy. In this study the efficacy of a MTX-based immuno-chemotherapy in patients older than 5 years with newly diagnosed PCNSL is analysed. Highdose MTX is combined with the oral lipophilic alkylating agents lomustine and procarbacine. In addition the the cytostatic therapy the monoclonal antibody rituximab is added for all patients with CD 20 positive PCNSL. Subsequently, a 6 months consolidation therapy with oral procarbacine for 5 days every 4 weeks is given. ;Recruiting complete, follow-up complete;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;http://www.drks.de//drks_web/navigate.do?navigationId=trial.HTML&TRIAL_ID=DRKS00000582;2019-03-13T08:26:24.350+01:00;;Freiburg;FALSE;

Despite maximal conservative and intensive care treatment only 20% of patients survive. Hemicraniectomy has been shown to reduce mortality from 70% to 20% in randomized controlled trials. Furthermore, the proportion of severely disabled patients is low (4%-5%) and does not differ compared to conservative treatment. Induced hypothermia is frequently used in critically ill patients for neuroprotection and has been shown to be effective in preventing hypoxic brain damage after cardiac arrest in large randomized controlled trials. There are several pilot studies also for ischemic stroke. However, there are no larger prospective randomized trials investigating induced hypothermia in malignant cerebral infarction. The aim of this study is to determine the safety and feasibility of combined hemicraniectomy and mild hypothermia (33-34 °C) in patients with space-occupying hemispheric infarctions versus hemicraniectomy alone.;Subtotal or complete infarctions of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory, occasionally with additional infarctions of the anterior cerebral artery (ACA) or the posterior cerebral artery (PCA) or both, are found in 1% to 10% of patients with ischemic supratentorial infarcts. These infarctions are commonly associated with serious brain swelling. Mass effect leads to the destruction of formerly healthy brain tissue, and, in severe cases, to extensive brain tissue shifts resulting in transforaminal, transtentorial, or uncal herniation and brain death in most cases. Because conservative treatment options usually fail, early decompressive hemicraniectomy has been used for several years as an alternative therapy. Meanwhile the benefit of hemicraniectomy has been demonstrated in randomized controlled trials in patients up to 60 years of age. Induced hypothermia is defined as  lowering of the physiological body core temperature which can be achieved by external or intravascular cooling devices. Hypothermia excerts its neuroprotective effects through various mechanisms including changes of the cerebral metabolism, stabilizartion of the blood-brain-barrier and inhibition of excytotoxic neuronal damage. These neuroprotective effects have been shown in randomized trials in patients with global hypoxia who were treated with induced hypothermia after cardiac arrest.  Furthermore, clinical studies have shown that elevated core body temperature is an independent predictor for mortality and bad functional outcome in acute stroke. Induced hypothermia in combination with decompressive surgery is used in some centers for the treatment of patients with malignant MCA infarctions on an indicidual basis. This study aims to investigate the safety and feasibility of mild induced hypothermia combisned with hemicraniectomy . Amendment: The authors decided to use a more conservative sample size calculation after the first safety analysis including the first 10 patients. Instead of a maximum of 71 patients included, an interim analysis will be conducted after patient 50. The decision to continue the trial will depend on the results of the interim analysis. Furthermore, the primary endpoint was defined more clearly as mortality on day 14. Mortality at discharge was cancelled.

Within this clinical trial patients will be treated whose stage of disease makes surgery impossible and radioiodine therapy has proved not possible or ineffective and, therefore, chemotherapy remains as the sole option. A combination of Doxorubicin and Everolimus (a m-TOR inhibitor) will be investigated. M-TOR-inhibitors prevent the transmission of growth stimuli within the cell. Doxorubicin will be administered intravenous once every three weeks, Everolimus will be taken by pill once daily. Because the combination of Doxorubicin and Everolimus has not been sufficiently investigated yet, the first 3-6 patients will get a low dose at the beginning. If sufficiently tolerated the dose will be increased every 3-6 patients up to a defined maximum dose.<br/>The main goal of the study is to determine the dose of combined treatment on which no unacceptable side effects occur. Additionally, the study is designed to see if Everolimus may induce a shrinkage of the tumor or inhibition of tumor growth.;With a 1%-proportion of all malignant tumors thyroid cancer belongs to the rare tumor entities. On the other hand it is the most frequent endocrine tumor and its incidence is increasing during the last 30 years. In Germany 3.7 men and 7.3 women of 100.000 are affected per year. Thyroid cancers arise from two cell types. The follicular cells give rise to the differentiated and undifferentiated types and C-cells give rise to the medullary type. Differentiated thyroid cancers account for 85–90% of cases and consist mainly of papillary and follicular subtypes. The poorly and undifferentiated category includes anaplastic thyroid carcinoma, which is one of the most aggressive and chemotherapy resistant tumors known in humans. The low incidence of these tumors makes prospective therapeutic studies very difficult, and to date, only few studies with small number of patients have been conducted.<br/>Genetic disposition, common geographic differences, incidence of struma, supply with iodide as well as ionizing radiation are considered as risk factors for the development of thyroid carcinoma.<br/>The outcome of affected patients especially depends on histology, tumor staging and age of the patient. With a 5 year survival rate of more than 80% the prognosis of differentiated and medullary thyroid cancer is comparatively good. In contrast clinical outcome of the highly aggressive anaplastic thyroid carcinoma is poor with a median survival time of 6 months. <br/>Until now chemotherapeutical treatment options (doxorubicin single or combination therapy) for either advanced undifferentiated, refractory differentiated or medullary thyroid cancer show limited efficacy.<br/>Recent data suggest activity of targeted drugs like axitinib, sorafenib, vandetanib and motesanib in thyroid cancer as single agents.<br/>However, randomized trials or placebo controlled trials are still missing.<br/><br/>This is an open-label, multi-center phase I study of continuous, escalating daily doses of RAD001 (Everolimus) combined with escalating doses of Doxorubicin given 3-weekly in adult patients suffering from advanced thyroid cancer. The study is designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) of combined treatment in this thyroid cancer population. Additionally, the study is designed to characterize the safety and tolerability of this therapy.<br/><br/>The study population will consist of male or female patients age ≥ 18 years diagnosed with progressive advanced thyroid cancer of follicular origin including papillary, follicular or poorly differentiated (insular or large-cell) thyroid cancer, with no further surgical treatment options and which is refractory to radioiodine treatment and if applicable to first line investigational treatment with sorafenib.;Recruiting complete, follow-up complete;Trial results;2ab99bcd-e684-4d6a-b742-dba53cadf0b6;Ergebnisbericht_Thyradox_V01F_2019-01-18_1.pdf;Ergebnisbericht gemäß AMG §42b Absatz 2;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;http://www.drks.de//drks_web/navigate.do?navigationId=trial.HTML&TRIAL_ID=DRKS00000635;2019-06-07T10:20:36.134+02:00;;Halle;FALSE;

This life-threatening condition requires intensive medical treatment, sometimes leaving some serious health consequences.<br/><br/>After discharge from hospital the surviving patients usually receive further treatment in Primary Care. How this long-term care can be supported practically, will be investigated through the intervention study SMOOTH- sponsored by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF). Our goal is the development of a sepsis-specific aftercare program.<br/>The SMOOTH study is part of the integrated research and treatment center for sepsis and sepsis sequelae (IFB / CSCC: Center for sepsis Control and Care) at the University Hospital of Jena.;Sepsis is a major public health concern in Germany and there is a growing need to deal with its considerable long-term effects. Approximately 50% of patients survive this life-threatening disease syndrome, but post-sepsis morbidity has long been ignored. Sepsis sequelae include critical illness polyneuropathy, myoopathy, wasting, PTSD, depression and chronic pain, but little is known about the extent of sepsis sequelae and their long-term impact on patient outcome. In addition, most sepsis patients are elderly and have complicating co-morbidities. This may result in a prolonged period of rehabilitation to return the patient to a functional and healthy condition. Due to a lack of tailored post discharge strategies in the primary hospital, lack of awareness and specific training in General Practitioner or local hospital clinicians as well as inadequate reimbursement by health insurers, surviving patients do not receive adequate long-term care.<br/><br/>The Smooth-Study wants to explore whether the quality of life and other clinical outcomes of sepsis patients can be improved by a specific follow-up in terms of a Disease management program (DMP).<br/> <br/>After surviving a sepsis episode, patients will be accompanied actively and in a structured way for the following year, in cooperation with their GPs. Following the structure of a disease management program (DMP) the intervention is divided into three areas:<br/><br/>-	Discharge management with structured information between inpatient and outpatient care<br/>-	Training of GPs and patients in sepsis-related illnesses with evidence based treatment options and guidelines<br/>-	Continuous monitoring of patients through specially designed telephone interviews regarding the main complications of sepsis. <br/><br/>The central point in the intervention is the Case Manager as an attender of the patients. There is also a liaison physician available as a contact for the family doctor (GP), to review the results of monitoring and to pass them on. In the study, both key personnel are provided by the Institute of General Medicine.<br/><br/>Primary endpoint of the study after 6 months is the health related quality of life of patients. The SF 36 questionnaire is an established measurement instrument for this purpose. Secondary outcome variables include the collection of physical activity, level of pain, depression symptoms, cognitive deficits, neuropathic symptoms and rehospitalisations - 6, 12 and 24 months after discharge from intensive care. <br/>;Recruiting complete, follow-up complete;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;http://www.drks.de//drks_web/navigate.do?navigationId=trial.HTML&TRIAL_ID=DRKS00000741;2017-11-28T14:35:38.843+01:00;;Jena;FALSE;

This risk is particularly high in colon surgery. So far there are no applicable local agent that reduces this risk. Of the implementation of the planned clinical trial, we hope to learn whether polyhexanide, which is already approved for treatment of wounds, can also be used prophylactically against wound infections, ie if one can reduce the number of infections of the wound when the wound is flushed before closing skin with it.<br/>Polyhexanide is already approved under the trade name LAVANID as a wound irrigation solution. The active ingredient comes e.g. in mouthwashes before oral care. Therefore, we know that the substance can kill germs and is very friendly.;The most common complication after surgical prosedures of  colon is a wound infection. According to the literature, it is 30%. In various hospitals measures for the prevention of wound infections were implemented, but they are rarely evidence-based. One such measure is the lavage of the wounds prior to skin closure with a 0.04% polyhexanide (LAVANID 2TM). Its effect covers also problematic bacteria such as MRSA. The 0.04% polyhexanide LAVANID 2TM is a certified wound irrigation, which is used due to its antibacterial effect for cleaning wounds and for moistening bandages.;Recruiting complete, follow-up complete;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;http://www.drks.de//drks_web/navigate.do?navigationId=trial.HTML&TRIAL_ID=DRKS00002698;2018-08-09T07:45:57.285+02:00;;Freiburg;FALSE;

This should lead to optimal assistance and support of patients’ self-regulation concerning their disease and its treatment. The development of the intervention refers to the Common-Sense Model of self-regulation, a theory that was developed by Howard Leventhal and colleagues. Considering the central components of this model, the intervention in patient information to be developed should incorporate three aspects: (1.) patient’ perceptions of illness and treatment (i.e. What do patients think about their illness and treatment?), (2.) previous coping behavior/action plans (i.e. What have patients already tried to overcome their disease? Do they for example have experience with medication or with rehabilitative treatment?) and (3.) the appraisal of coping behavior/action plans (i.e. Was the coping behavior successful or not from the patients’ point of view?).<br/><br/>The first step of our project will be to develop a questionnaire based on the Common-Sense Model of self-regulation to assess coping behavior and its appraisal. This questionnaire will then be psychometrically tested on N=400 patients with chronic low back pain and depressive disorders. Based on these findings, the intervention will be developed in the second step of the project. This will take place in cooperation with physicians and psychologists from six rehabilitation centres, in which this concept will be implemented and formatively evaluated. Here, qualitative as well as quantitative designs will be applied. Primary Outcomes will be acceptance on patients’ and professionals’ side and clinical feasibility. The project should result in an intervention that is seen as useful and beneficial from both patients’ and professionals’ view and which can be integrated into clinical procedures.<br/>;Recruiting complete, follow-up complete;Paper;[---]*;[---]*;Glattacker, M., Heyduck, K., Nagl, M., & Jakob, T.

Aneurysms are being filled with small coils made of platinum. The major disadvantage of this technique lies in the fact that about one fourth of all aneurysms treated this way, will re-open. Patients with re-opened aneurysms are not 100% protected of an aneurysmal bleed. <br/>A new class of coils aim at reducing the recanalisation rate by improving the aneurysm packing [HydroSoft coils (Hydrocoil Embolic<br/>System, MicroVention Inc.)]. The present trial aims to compare major aneurysm recurrence rate on follow-up angiography at 18<br/>months between patients treated with HydroSoft coils and patients treaterd with coils made of platinum. Patients from different centres in France, Germany, and Austria will be included.;"Endovascular coiling treatment is now the preferred treatment option for many intracranial<br/>aneurysms. However, aneurysm recurrences and rebleeds are more frequent after endovascular<br/>treatment than neurosurgical clipping. Therefore follow-up is mandatory and important to the<br/>ongoing patient management. Major recurrences following endovascular treatment are associated<br/>with both a high retreatment rate and with a substantially increased risk of aneurysmal rebleed.<br/>Major recurrences occur in 15% to 19% of cases by 3-6 months, rising to 21% at a mean of 16<br/>months of follow-up. An endovascular treatment that substantially reduced the major recurrence<br/>rate would be expected to reduce both the rebleed rate and the retreatment rate, which would be to<br/>the benefit of patients and health care systems alike. The HydroSoft coils (Hydrocoil Embolic<br/>System, MicroVention Inc.) offer the prospect of improved aneurysm packing and angiographic<br/>outcomes.<br/>The present trial aims to compare major aneurysm recurrence rate on follow-up angiography at 18<br/>months between patients allocated HydroSoft versus patients allocated bare platinum coiling.<br/>Secondary outcomes to be compared between the two groups include: packing density; coil length<br/>deployed; clinical outcome at 6 and 18 months post-coiling (measured by the modified Rankin<br/>scale); re-bleed and re-treatment rates. 306 patients will be required to demonstrate a reduction in<br/>major recurrence rate from 15% with bare platinum to 5% with HydroSoft treatment.

Due to androgen resistance the external genitailia is female. The patients perceive themselves in a female gender role. Based on the assumption that the gonads carry a  higher risk for malignacy they mostly have been removed. As a consequence these women have been substituted with<br/>estradiol. Under this treatment patients complained of a decrease of well- being and sexual lifequality. In self-induced experiments patients probed testosteron as an alternative substitution and reported an enhancement of psychological and sexual lifequality. In our study we will compare the two medications in patients with CAIS.;Complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS) is characterized as a completely female external phenotype in 46,XY individuals despite high endogenous testosterone secretion via the intact testes due to mutation of the androgen receptor (AR). After gonadectomy patients recieve estrogens<br/> as hormone substitution. However, after gonadectomy, many patients have voiced severe complains about lack of self-esteem, libido and overall well-being. Therefore, we propose a study comparing the endocrine profiles of patients with proven CAIS with the arbitrary conventional treatment with estradiol compared to an experimental treatment with testosterone, both applied transdermally. We hypothesize that testosterone treatment will improve quality of life and well-being because of different expected profiles of estrogen and androgen levels in these patients.  As control parameters, we will determine blood parameters that are affected in a secondary fashion by sex steroids.

The use of chemotherapy is considered to be the standard therapy in most of the patients. To commend a drug or drug combination is still under investigation. 90 patients will be enrolled in this study. The patients receive pazopanib or the drug combination pazopanib  and gemcitabine. The object of both treatment arms will be the decrease or cessation of tumour growth. If the additional administration of gemcitabin offers better response rates will be investigated within the study.;Soft tissue sarcomas (STS) are malignant tumors of connective tissue (mesenchyme). STS have traditionally been managed by wide excision surgery and radiotherapy, being the only curative approach. However, in many patients even optimal local treatment does often not prevent the occurrence of distant metastasis, especially those with high-grade tumors. Primary sites of metastasizes are the lungs but also bone, liver and other organs, depending on the subtype. The use of chemotherapy has been reserved for advanced disease for systemic control. <br/>Patients with relapsed or metastatic soft tissue sarcoma are candidates for clinical trials of new drugs because treatment outcomes remain unsatisfactory and are limited to palliation in the vast majority of cases.<br/>Pazopanib is an orally available, multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), which is currently tested in several clinical trials and diverse tumor types. Targets of this drug are VEGFR, PDGF and c-kit. Currently the approval for renal cell carcinoma in Europe is authorized. Therefore pazopanib represents an attractive therapeutic agent in combination with conventional chemotherapies in relapsed or metastatic STS.<br/>In majority of cases single agent is far less active as combining with conventionell chemotherapy. Several clinical studies suggest that Gemcitabine is a promising partner drug with pazopanib in STS.<br/>The objective of this trial is to assess the efficacy and toxicity of pazopanib alone or pazopanib plus gemcitabine in patients with relapsed or metastatic soft tissue sarcoma.;Recruiting complete, follow-up complete;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;http://www.drks.de//drks_web/navigate.do?navigationId=trial.HTML&TRIAL_ID=DRKS00003139;2017-07-10T09:10:49.968+02:00;;Halle;FALSE;

One reason for exacerbation is a reduced self-care, i.e. a reduced adherence towards treatment recommendations and a reduced ability to detect symptoms of exacerbation at an early stage and response to it adequately. Self-care can be improved by education and counseling. This study aims to find out if a nurse-led education and counseling session is able to improve patients self-care, care dependency and quality of life. Patient with chronic heart failure admitted to an hospital will receive an individual education and counseling about heart failure with consecutive telephone follow-up over three months (4 calls). During these calls patients will be asked about their self-care behaviors and state of health. After three months patients received heart failure education and counseling will be compared to a similar group of heart failure patients without specific education/counseling. It is assumed that patients with heart failure education/counseling shows improved self-care, care dependency and quality of life;Heart Failure (HF) is one of the most prevalent diseases in western industrialized countries with high economic and individual burden. Patients with HF suffer from reduced physical and social role functioning and quality of life. Treatment expenses of HF add up to 2% of the total health care expenditure with hospitalisation as the most cost-intensive part of it. Using a nurse-led education and counselling programme to promote self-care in patients with HF is a promising strategy to maintain or enhance health and quality of life of the patient as well as to prevent exacerbation of HF with consecutive need of health care services. To date there is no evidence that such a strategy is working for a German HF population. Therefore the aim of the study is to determine the effect of a nurse-led education and counselling programme on self-care, care dependency and quality of life in a German HF population.;Recruiting complete, follow-up complete;Paper;[---]*;[---]*;"Köberich, S.; Lohrmann, C.; Mittag, O.; Dassen, T.

The majority of cases of this severe disease could be prevented by early detection and removal of cancer precursors and early cancer stages. There are a number of methods for early detection of colorectal cancer, such as the test for blood in stool (fecal occult blood test). However, this test is not very sensitive to early stages of cancer. This means, that it is possible that the test does not show blood in the stool sample, although the disease is present. Therefore, it is necessary to develop better tests. At the moment, the best method for early detection is a screening colonoscopy, but many people do not want to undergo this invasive test.<br/>In a recent study, our group has shown that the sensitivity of tests for blood in stool was strongly increased in study participants that took acetylsalicylic acid on a regular basis. Acetylsalicylic acid is marketed in Germany by Bayer under the name Aspirin®. The study results suggest that the use of acetylsalicylic acid before a test for blood in stool could be a promising approach to better early detection of colorectal cancer. However, acetylsalicylic acid was only used by about 10% of the participants in our study and in almost all cases it was taken on a regular basis for a longer period of time. Although we expect that a single dose of acetylsalicylic acid will have the same effect, this has not been studied so far. In addition, most of the acetylsalicylic acid users were men and thus the effects in women are unclear.<br/><br/>What will be done:<br/>In the current study, we will study two tests for blood in stool after a single low dose of acetylsalicylic acid. Acetylsalicylic acid or placebo will be given to 2400 study participants between 40 and 80 years of age at least 5 days before a planned, study-independent colonoscopy. Stool samples will be collected at the start of the study and 2, 3 and 4 days after the dose of acetylsalicylic acid/placebo. The results of the stool tests will be compared to the results of the colonoscopy. <br/><br/>Study question:<br/>To evaluate diagnostic performance (sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, likelihood ratios, area under the curve) of 2 immunochemical Fecal Occult Blood Tests (iFOBTs) for detecting advanced colorectal neoplasms after a single dose of acetylsalicylic acid as compared to placebo.<br/>Additional questions in this study are if there are differences in effects between men and women and if the test becomes better if stool samples collected on multiple days are combined.<br/>In the future, blood tests may also play a role in early detection of colorectal cancer. So far, no such tests are available. Therefore, an optional blood sample collection is part of this study. This blood sample will be used to study new blood markers for early detection of colorectal cancer in the future.<br/>;With over 1.2 million new cases and over 600,000 deaths annually, colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer and the fourth most common cancer cause of death worldwide. Its typically slow progression from detectable and fully curable precursors (adenomas) gives much better perspectives for prevention by early detection than for most other cancer types. Thus, the majority of CRCs could be prevented by endoscopy with detection and removal of adenomas. However, participation of patients in endoscopic screening programs is low, likely due to its invasiveness. Higher participation rates can be achieved with non-invasive stool- or blood-based screening tests. However, these tests suffer from poor sensitivity. In a recent study by our group, sensitivity for detecting advanced colorectal neoplasms by immunochemical fecal occult blood test (iFOBT) was 70.8% among users of low-dose aspirin compared with 35.9% among non-users (p=0.001), whereas there were only very small differences in specificity. In ROC analysis, the area under the curve (AUC) was much higher for users than for non-users, with particularly strong differences in men (0.87 versus 0.68, p=0.003). This finding suggests that use of low-dose aspirin before conduction of iFOBT might be a promising approach to improve non-invasive screening for CRC. In the randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study that we propose here, we will evaluate the diagnostic performance (sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, likelihood ratios, area under the curve) of two iFOBTs for detecting advanced colorectal neoplasms after a single dose of low-dose aspirin compared to application of the tests without prior use of aspirin. Aspirin or placebo will be administered at least 5 days before a planned, study-independent colonoscopic screening in 2000 participants aged 40 to 80 years. Stool samples will be obtained at baseline and 2, 3, and 4 days after the single dose of aspirin/placebo. The diagnostic performance of the iFOBTs will be compared to the results of the colonoscopy as a gold standard for the diagnosis of colorectal neoplasms. <br/>Additional study questions include gender-specific performance of the tests and gain in diagnostic performance by test application on multiple days.<br/>In addition, an optional blood sample is taken for future biomarker studies.<br/>;Recruiting complete, follow-up complete;trial protocol (mandatory for transfer to Studybox);[---]*;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30249195;Studienprotokoll;Paper;[---]*;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Effect+of+a+Single+Aspirin+Dose+Prior+to+Fecal;Studienpublikation;;;;;;;;;;;;;http://www.drks.de//drks_web/navigate.do?navigationId=trial.HTML&TRIAL_ID=DRKS00003252;2020-03-12T14:15:18.003+01:00;;Heidelberg;FALSE;

The background to this research project is the decision of the Federal Joint Committee, which states that the negative pressure wound therapy can`t be accepted as a standard therapy with complete performance of the health insurance reimbursement. This decision is based on the reports of the Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care about already existing study projects, which showed a lack of evidence regarding the use of this form of therapy for the treatment of acute and chronic wounds.<br/>This study will be performed in several hospitals in Germany. The study is due to evaluate whether  the negative pressure wound therapy or the control therapy (standard wound therapy following the guidelines) is superior with respect to the target values. <br/>Patients will be randomly assigned to the two study arms. Both patients and the treatment staff know about the specific allocation to the negative pressure wound therapy or standard wound therapy arm.<br/>The target values of the investigation are clinical, safety and economic indicators.<br/>The two primary outcome measures are the achievement of a complete wound closure and the time required to achieve this within a treatment period of 16 weeks.<br/>A photo documentation and a computer-based evaluation of the wound images will be performed. This is done centrally by independent examiners, who don`t know neither the patient nor the treatment assignment.<br/>Due to the results of already existing clinical studies and the experience from the clinical application it is believed that the application of the negative pressure wound therapy systems compared to standard therapy of diabetic foot wounds will lead more frequent and more rapid to the achievement of complete wound closure. Furthermore, it is believed that the use of negative pressure wound therapy is an effective and safe therapy option for the treatment of diabetic foot wounds in inpatient and outpatient care.<br/>Patient´s to be included into the study should have either a chronic diabetic foot wound existing longer than 4 weeks whereas dead tissue components must be completely removed by the doctor or a wound after amputation of foot parts.<br/>The study treatment may have already started in the hospital if applicable. The further wound treatment will be mainly performed within outpatient care. Study Participants will return to the study centre for regular study visits or even for wound treatment. <br/>The comparison of the outcomes of both study arms will give valuable information about the efficacy of negative pressure wound therapy in inpatient as well as outpatient care. These results should be provided until the end of 2014 as a basis for the decision of the Federal Joint Committee to answer the question if the negative pressure wound therapy can be approved as a standard service for reimbursement by health insurance companies.<br/>;"This study project as part of a European tender has the aim to prove efficacy and effectiveness of negative pressure wound therapy in the management of patients with chronic diabetic foot wounds. The tasks within the study project have been assigned to three contractors / institutions. <br/>On behalf of a consortium of 19 health insurance companies with a central contact consisting of the “AOK-Bundesverband GbR”, “Verband der Ersatzkassen e.V.” (vdek) and the “Knappschaft” these contractors are responsible for conducting the trial.<br/>The Institute for Research in Operative Medicine (IFOM) as part of the University of Witten / Herdecke gGmbH is responsible for the planning, implementation, analysis and publication of the study. <br/>The Private University of Witten / Herdecke takes over the sponsorship of the study project. The duties and responsibilities of the sponsor are transferred to the staff of the Institute for Research in Operative Medicine of University of Witten / Herdecke. The financial support of the clinical study is provided by the manufacturers of the negative pressure wound therapy systems. The task of payment processing and the contractual provisions is taken over by a management company “Gesundheitsforen Leipzig”.<br/>Therapy systems used within the treatment arm of the study will be provided by two manufacturers Kinetic Concepts Incorporated (KCI) and Smith & Nephew. All used treatment systems bear the CE mark and will be used within normal conditions of clinical routine and according to manufacturer's instructions.<br/>This research project is performed because of a decision of the Federal Joint Committee Germany, which states that negative pressure wound therapy can´t be accepted as a standard therapy with full reimbursement by the health insurance companies in Germany. This decision is based on the rapid report and the final report of the Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care, which showed through systematic reviews and meta-analysis of previous study projects that an insufficient state evidence regarding the use of negative pressure wound therapy for the treatment of acute and chronic wounds is existing.<br/>This study evaluates the treatment outcome of the application of a technical medical device, which is based on the principle of negative pressure wound therapy (treatment group 1: Intervention Group) in comparison to standard wound therapy (treatment group 2: Control group) in the treatment of chronic foot wounds after adequate (debridement of avital tissue) wound preparation or amputation wounds resulting from a scheduled amputation below the ankle (Latin. talocruralis articulation), which are caused in the context of a diabetic foot syndrom.<br/>The clinical trial is designed as a national, multicenter, prospective, randomized controlled superiority study. A blinded evaluation of wound photographs will be performed.<br/>Patients will be randomized 1:1 to the treatment arm: negative pressure wound therapy and the control arm: standard wound therapy.<br/>Patients will be stratified according to assignment to the participating institution (hospital) and by Wagner-Armstrong Stadium.<br/>The inclusion and exclusion criteria are based on the presence of a diagnosis of a diabetic foot wound, the regulatory requirements to the participants in a clinical study and the examination and treatment according to current treatment regulations, evidence-based guidelines and the specifications of the manufacturers of the medical devices.<br/>Only patients meeting all inclusion criteria and no exclusion criterion are allowed to be included into the trial.<br/>The aim of this study is to compare the clinical, safety and economic results of both treatment arms.<br/>The primary endpoints to evaluate the efficacy of negative pressure wound therapy in the treatment of chronic foot wounds caused by a diabetic foot syndrome are both the number of complete wound closure within the maximum treatment period (measured in days) as well as the time until complete wound closure. Complete wound closure should be achieved within the maximum study treatment period of 16 weeks.<br/>In addition, secondary clinical endpoints and safety endpoints, patient-reported outcome endpoints and health economic endpoints are evaluated.<br/>The clinical examination includes parameters that can be used for the analysis of resource use in the inpatient and outpatient care. This includes a comparative analysis of parameters of direct and indirect resource use.<br/>Primarily the perspective of the Statutory Health Insurance is considered. As a secondary perspective the view of society was selected.<br/>Sample size calculation was performed considering results of existing trials, which revealed that a number n = 324 patients must be included in the study in order to carry out the analysis of the primary endpoint ""Closure rate"".<br/>In due consideration of screening failures, discontinuation of therapy of any cause and losses to Follow-Up a screening of a total of 464 patients must be performed to provide the calculated sample size.The primary efficacy analysis is performed using the intention-to-treat group.<br/>Study results will be provided until the end of 2014 to contribute to the final decision of the Federal Joint Committee Germany regarding the general admission of negative pressure wound therapy as a standard of performance within both medical sectors.<br/>";Recruiting complete, follow-up complete;Paper;[---]*;https://trialsjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1745-6215-15-334;Trials Journal STUDY PROTOCOL: Negative pressure wound therapy versus standard wound care in chronic diabetic foot wounds: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;http://www.drks.de//drks_web/navigate.do?navigationId=trial.HTML&TRIAL_ID=DRKS00003347;2017-09-05T09:48:18.198+02:00;;Witten-Herdecke;FALSE;

We could show that cue exposure based extinction training can successfully reduce this reactivity in alcohol patients. During extinction training the patients are confronted with their preferred alcoholic beverage. The alcohol craving should be extinguished or at least reduced in the course of several sessions. In this project, we aim to study the effect of extinction by means of brain imaging methods. We assume that these measures may allow the definition of subgroups that benefit differentially from a cue-exposure based extinction training. This could be helpful for the improvement of the psychotherapeutic treatment of alcohol dependent patients.<br/>;The aim of this project is to explore the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the increased cue reactivity often observed in alcohol dependence. Cue reactivity in this context means the response to conditioned stimuli associated with addiction. On a neurobiological level, increased striatal activation triggered by such “cues” can be observed. Increased cue reactivity has been indentified as a risk factor for the occurrence of addictive disorders and relapses in such patients. Cue-exposure-based extinction training (CET), i.e. the confrontation of patients with alcohol cues without the consumption behavior has been described ia an effective treatment in a number of studies. This project will examine whether particular neurobiological characteristics of the patients have an impact on the effectiveness of CET. The theory of extinction learining assumes that extinction occurs through an inhibition of striatal regions via prefrontal projections. Therefore we expect that the extent of functional and structural coupling of prefrontal and striatral brain regions influences the success of CET in alcohol dependent patients. In addition, we want to study whether the reactivity of the striatral regions to non-alcohol-related rewards also has predictive power for the effect of the treatment. Finally, we examine on a subgroup of patients, whether neurofeedback-training can strengthen the effect of extinction training and, if so,  to what extent this effect is also modulated by the fronto-striatal connectivity of the patients.;Recruiting complete, follow-up complete;Paper;[---]*;[---]*;Kirsch, M., Gruber, I., Ruf, M., Kiefer, F., & Kirsch, P.

Such intergenerational transmission of physical and psychological abuse has been observed by clinicians and other health professionals. The present project not only seeks to understand this so-called “cycle of abuse”, but aims to evaluate therapeutic interventions to break this vicious circle. It is assumed that, in such case, the parenting abilities are fundamentally disturbed, because these mothers have experienced physical and sexual abuse or neglect mainly by their own caregivers. Further investigation of the transmission of abuse is needed to understand its underlying mechanisms and to design successful intervention and prevention programs. <br/>On the one hand, the present project investigates the impact of mothers’ history of child abuse on their child regarding its mental health, development and quality of life at the age of 5-12 years. On the other hand, it focuses on maternal stress hormone levels, epigenetic analyses and neuronal activities during emotion recognition and regulation by means of fMRI. In addition, diagnostic interviews and questionnaires are carried out. <br/>60 abused mothers and their 5-12-year-old child will be randomized to either a Parent-Child-Interaction-Therapy (PCIT) or dose-matched individual stress management training for mothers (each comprised of 12 weekly sessions).The Parent-Child-Interaction-Therapy includes coaching of the mother with respect to the mother-child interaction. The intervention groups will be compared regarding maternal sensitivity, maternal abuse potential, child mental health and quality of life immediately after the intervention and 6 months later.<br/>;Given the high prevalence of mothers with a history of abuse who maltreat their own children, a better understanding of an intergenerational transmission of abuse is urgently needed. Moreover, it is of crucial importance to evaluate effective interventions to stop this vicious cycle. The aim of the study is to investigate dysfunctional interactions of traumatized mother-child dyads by combining basic neurobiological research with randomized controlled intervention trials. The project focusses on the dyadic interaction by investigating (1) the behavioural and (neuro)biological correlates of maternal sensitivity, affect regulation and child abuse potential, i.e. neural mechanisms, hormones and (epi-)genetics and (2) the impact of maternal behavior and characteristics on her child’s well-being including its emotional and cognitive development. The sample is comprised of 60 mother-child-dyads with a maternal history of abuse and 30 healthy control dyads.<br/>The effectiveness of an intervention program with a specific focus on mother-child interaction will be compared to non-dyadic treatments in randomized controlled trials. More precisely, the intervention groups will be compared regarding maternal sensitivity, maternal abuse potential, child mental health and quality of life immediately after the intervention and 6 months later. The “intervention study” is comprised of 60 mother-child-dyads (abused mothers with non-optimal maternal sensitivity and their 7-year-old children).<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>;Recruiting complete, follow-up complete;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;http://www.drks.de//drks_web/navigate.do?navigationId=trial.HTML&TRIAL_ID=DRKS00003442;2017-01-09T10:24:50.795+01:00;;Heidelberg;FALSE;

evaluation of Iloprost in the early postoperative period after liver transplantation;PRAISE-Study;http://www.praise.uniklinikum-jena.de/PRAISE.html;The clinical course after liver transplantation is essentially determined by the graft function. Poor working grafts lead to an increased risk of complication, e.g.  the occurrence of serious infections. In single cases these infections can become live-threatening. The most serious manifestation of a poor working liver graft is the initial non-function with the requirement of high urgent re-transplantation.<br/><br/>The risk for poor working liver grafts is increased by using organs of lower quality. Due to the lack of organs in Germany, it is necessary to make also use of these organs. It is a major concern to find alternative possibilities in order to  reduce the rate of poor working liver grafts.<br/><br/>The characteristic of the drug Iloprost above others is to inhibit aggregation of platelets and widens blood vessels. Therefore the tissue perfusion (micro-circulation) can be improved. The presented study proves the assumption that application of Iloprost improves the perfusion of the liver graft and therefore lead to a better graft function. This should be reflected in a lower rate of complications. The study participantes receive randomly assigned whether the drug Iloprost or a placebo directly after transplantation for 7 days in total. During these 7 days individual blood samples are taken and liver funcional tests are performed besides the usual routine analysis.  The all over monitoring time of this study takes six months.;"The incidence of primary graft dysfunction (PDF) after liver transplantation (LT) is approximately 25%. Initial non-function (INF) develops in up to 6% of these cases and requires urgent retransplantation. As possible causes several factors are being discussed. These relate to the age of the donor, cold ischemic time or serious steatosis of the graft as potential risk factors. In accordance with these investigations about the incidence of PDF the severity of developing hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI) is one of the main reasons for graft dysfunction.<br/>Due to the continuing shortage of donor organs within Germany the transplant centers are forced to accept so called marginal organs. The more criteria of a marginal organ are met, the higher is the risk for the development of a dysfunction of the transplanted liver. Organ dysfunction may deteriorate to complete organ failure and increases perioperative morbidity and mortality after transplantation. Therapeutic strategies for reducing the rate of organ dysfunction and for the treatment of malfunctions with medication are of current clinical relevance. One approach is the systemic application of prostaglandin derivatives.<br/><br/>Many authors reported about the clinical use of the synthetic prostaglandin-I2 (PGI2)-analogue Iloprost. Based on inducing vasodilatation it has been utilized in pulmonary hypertension. Off-label systemically administered iloprost as adjuvant in elective abdominal aortic aneurysm surgery or after revascularisation of acute lower limb ischemia based on improving microcirculation was reported. In these studies the iloprost infusion was associated with significant reduction of morbidity and mortality. <br/><br/>Bärthel et al. (2011) evaluated the impact of iloprost in 80 liver transplanted patients in a prospective, randomized (1:1), open-label, single-center pilot study.<br/>These data indicate that intravenous administered iloprost (1ng/kg BW/min) improves the graft function particularly in the early postoperative period.<br/>These results are encouraging. There is, however, preliminary evidence to suggest beneficial effects in this particular clinical scenario. The clinical outcome after LT is affected by various donor and recipient characteristics. In order to define the specific impact of iloprost on liver graft function, this prospective, multicenter, randomized, doubleblinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial including an appropriate number of patients will be performed. The investigational medicinal product will be iloprost. It will be administered intra-venous continuously over seven days. The placebo group receives the placebo that is administered in the same dosage and application form.<br/>The end of the trial duration for each patient is reached 180 days after LT (after 6 months). The follow up period will be 180 days (6 months) with assessment after 270 and 360 days (9 and 12 months) after LT.<br/><br/>The primary objective of this trial is the rate of PDF after LT. It is evaluated using the following definition: PDF is characterized as presentation of one or more of the following criteria: ALAT or ASAT level > 2000 IU/ml within the first 7 postoperative days; bilirubin ≥ 10 mg/dl on postoperative day 7; INR ≥ 1.6 on postoperative day 7 or as occurrence of initial non-function (INF) defined as graft failure originating from the graft itself, excluding hepatic artery thrombosis (HAT), biliary complication, recurrent disease or acute rejection and resulting in retransplantation or patient death within 14 days after initial LT.<br/><br/>Based on the results of previous investigations a relative reduction of PDF incidence of<br/>50% by iloprost compared to placebo is expected.";Recruiting stopped after recruiting started ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;http://www.drks.de//drks_web/navigate.do?navigationId=trial.HTML&TRIAL_ID=DRKS00003514;2015-01-05T12:47:51.347+01:00;;Jena;FALSE;

A stoma is a surgically-created opening in the intestine that allows the removal of feces out of the body. It is created by bringing the end or loop of intestine out onto the surface of the skin.<br/>In our study we compare two different types of stoma positioning on the abdominal wall: in one group the stoma is placed lateral to (beside) the rectus abdominis muscle (the ""six pack"" muscle which runs vertically on each side of the midline of the belly). In the other group of patients (the control group) the stoma is pulled out through the rectus abdominis muscle (transrectal).<br/>Up to now it remains unclear which operative technique is to prefer to prevent parastomal hernia (= a bulge on the belly which occurs when weakness in the abdominal wall is sufficient to permit abdominal contents to protrude through the fascial defect around the stoma) and other complications.<br/>The main goal of our study is to find out which stoma position has the lowest incidence of parastomal herniation. Moreover we will investigate other stoma complications, such as prolapse, ileus, and stenosis.<br/>The rate of parastomal hernias is high (30-50%) and the consequences and implications of parastomal hernias are relevant for patients. Most of the patients suffer from a perturbed body image and many of them have increased difficulties to apply the stoma bag properly leading to leakage and skin irritation. In rare cases, bowel incarceration occurs requiring emergency surgery.";A parastomal hernia is defined as an incisional hernia related to a stoma and belongs to the most common stoma-related complications. The incidence of parastomal hernias varies widely depending on the length of follow up and the type of stoma. It affects about 2-28 % of end ileostomies and 0-6 % of loop ileostomies. For colostomies, the rates are 4-48 % and 0-31 % respectively.The  consequences and implications of parastomal hernias are highly relevant for patients. Most of the patients suffer from a perturbed body image and many of them have increased difficulties to apply the stoma bag properly leading to leakage and skin irritation. In rare cases, bowel incarceration occurs requiring emergency surgery. In addition, stomal herniation necessitating reoperation and hospitalization has a negative socioeconomic impact, especially since recurrence rates after operative correction are high.<br/>Concluding, the need for prevention of parastomal herniation is obvious. But how can this be achieved? There has been a lot of debate about possible risk factors, such as obesity, wound infection, steroid therapy, and COPD. Moreover the operative technique has consistently been up for discussion. Today most surgeons believe that the transrectal site is to prefer in terms of hernia prevention, though this has never been proven by a randomized study. As there is no clinical evidence from randomized studies, the PATRASTOM trial has been designed. A preliminary systematic literature search was performed on this topic to collect all relevant data. Moreover, a corresponding title for a systematic review within the Cochrane Colorectal Cancer Group was registered and the protocol was published in December 2011.<br/>In summary the need for a randomized trial is evident and urgent as parastomal herniation is not rare, difficult to manage and associated with high morbidity. Results of this trial could yield a considerable individual patient-benefit (prevented parastomal discomfort or pain, difficulty with appliance application, and life-threatening complications, such as strangulation and perforation). Impact on clinical practice is therefore potentially high and relevant both from the patient’s perspective and socio-economic standpoint.;Recruiting complete, follow-up complete;Paper;[---]*;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26713666;Die Ergebnisse der PATRASTOM Studie wurden in Colorectal Disease im Dezember 2015 veröffentlicht.

For the most part, the communication takes place via telephone.<br/> <br/>The intervention aims at positively influencing the symptoms of depression by the care manager’s proactive support of the treatment provided by the GP. This support comprises patient education, behavioral activation, and the introduction of relapse prevention and problem solving techniques (as needed). The continuous monitoring of the symptoms allows for an individual adaptation of the intervention according to a model of stepped care.<br/> <br/>Moreover, a psychiatrist or psychotherapist as part of the study team serves as a supervising specialist. GP, care manager, and supervising psychiatrist/ psychotherapist form the IMPACT intervention team and communicate with each other on a regular basis.<br/><br/>In order to continuously monitor the depressive symptoms and to adapt the treatment where indicated, the care manager assesses the patients’ score on the  PHQ-9 questionnaire via interview on a regular basis. This assessment is independent of the assessments of the primary and secondary outcome carried out by members of the data management team (baseline, 6 months, 12 months).<br/> <br/>Every 8 weeks, the therapeutic outcome is evaluated by the IMPACT intervention team. In case of no or only partial response (< 50% reduction in the PHQ-9 score), the treatment is adapted following an algorithm of stepped care (e.g., change of drug type or dose, or combination of medication and problem solving techniques).<br/><br/>All patients (intervention and control group) can be referred to a specialist as needed (according to national clinical practice guidelines).

Aim of all training opportunities will be to get familiar with the new recommendations and practice its application. <br/><br/>In order to assess whether or not an involvement of the whole office personnel is more effective than an intervention on physician level alone, the intervention group will further be randomized into an intervention on physician level only and an intervention involving the whole office team. ;Arm 2;In the control group, the general practitioners will not receive material with the new developed recommendations on how to avoid potentially inappropriate medication in the elderly. Instead, usual recommendations for the pharmacotherapy in the elderly will be applied. As the intervention group, all physicians of the control group will be invited to participate in continuing education and training towards pharmacotherapy in the elderly. In the control group, the practice team will not be involved.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Interventional;[---]*;Randomized controlled trial;Open (masking not used);Active control;Treatment;Parallel;N/A;N/A;The primary analysis will be done on the office level to account for the cluster design. ANCOVA will be used to compare the proportion of patients per office with potentially inappropriate medication after 12 months of follow up. For the primary analysis, no difference will be made in the intervention group between the subgroups of intervention on physician level only and the involvement of the whole practice team. Potentially inappropriate medication will be defined as either at least one potentially inappropriate drug or at least one relevant drug-drug interaction or at least one inadequate dosage of a drug as defined by the PRISCUS list. The ANCOVA will account for the group assignment (intervention of control group) as a factor, and the proportion of patients per office with potentially inappropriate medication at baseline will be considered as a co-variate. All randomized offices will be analyzed according to the group assigned. Missing values in the potentially inappropriate medication variable during follow up will be replaced by the baseline value. ;All secondary analyses will be explorative. As a secondary analysis, the subgroups in the intervention group (intervention on physician level only versus intervention on the practice team level) will be compared. The analysis will be done as already described for the primary endpoint.

Improper medication is assumed to cause side effects, reduced quality of life, more hospital admissions and other negative consequences. Improper medication may by avoided by lists like the German PRISCUS list published in 2010. The list contains drugs that are assumed to be improper in the opinion of experts. The list also gives hints how drugs may interact, and how drugs should be dosed appropriately. A training of general practitioners based on such a list may reduce improper medication.<br/><br/>To evaluate this, a scientific project is planned and conducted. In a total of 140 general practitioners offices in the cities of Witten and Hannover, 12 patients in each office aged ≥ 70 years and taking at least 6 drugs on a regular basis will be examined. The treating physicians will either get usual recommendations towards pharmacotherapy in the elderly, or they will be advised and trained in new developed recommendations based on the PRISCUS list. After 12 month, the proportion of patients receiving at least one improper medication will be assessed, and the proportions will be compared between the differently trained physician groups. It is assumed that one in four patients will get at least one improper medication, and that the new developed recommendations will reduce the proportion of patients with improper medication by a third.<br/>;Potentially inappropriate medication is a prevalent problem in elderly with chronic diseases and especially multimorbid patients. Potentially inappropriate medication is related to adverse drug events, reduced quality of life, more hospital admissions and other negative health consequences. Drugs-to-avoid lists, like the German PRISCUS list published in 2010, may help to avoid potentially inappropriate medication. The list contains drugs that are assumed to be inappropriate in the opinion of experts. The list also makes recommendations concerning drug-drug interactions and dosage. In primary care, a training intervention based on a drugs-to-avoid list may reduce potentially inappropriate medication.<br/><br/>To evaluate this, a prospective, cluster-randomized controlled clinical trial is planned and accomplished. In a total of 140 general practitioners offices in the cities of Witten and Hannover, 12 patients per office aged ≥ 70 years and taking at least 6 drugs on a regular basis will be enrolled. Offices will be randomized into a control group which will get usual recommendations towards pharmacotherapy in the elderly, while the intervention group will receive new developed recommendations and training to avoid potentially inappropriate medication on basis of the PRISCUS list. After 12 month of follow-up, the proportion of patients receiving at least one potentially inappropriate medication will be compared between both control and intervention group. Given a prevalence of potentially inappropriate medication of 25%, the study will be powered to detect a risk reduction of 9% to 16%, equivalent to a relative risk (RR) of 0.64.;Recruiting complete, follow-up complete;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;http://www.drks.de//drks_web/navigate.do?navigationId=trial.HTML&TRIAL_ID=DRKS00003610;2015-02-10T09:21:20.863+01:00;;Bochum;FALSE;

An open-label, randomized, controlled, phase 3-b clinical trial;Treosulfan in ovarian cancer (IOM 10 / 01);[---]*;Generally, this substance is well-toleratede and exists as both an infusion as well as tablets. In elderly patients the tolerability, efficacy and preference  in cancer therapy is rarely known. This study compares both therapies together. The patients will be asked on their preference (tablet or infusion) and only if there is no decision-making ability assigned by randomization (random). In addition, the geriatric assessment will be used.;Treosulfan, which is the active ingredient of the trial medication Ovastat® und Ovastat® 1000 / Ovastat® 5000, is a water-soluble prodrug which, by means of hydrolytic (non-enzymatic) activation, releases two alkylating groups that have cytotoxic effects. These two groups being L-diepoxybutane and intermediary products of monoepoxide. <br/>There has been in vivo and in vitro verification of enhanced activity against different types of solid tumors and mutations of the hematopoetic system. Treosulfan in capsule form for oral application has been approved since 1981 and as an injectable preparation has been approved for the treatment of ovarian cancer since 1991. <br/>Dose-limiting side-effect of this therapy is the bone marrow toxicity which is generally reversible. Other side-effects affect the skin (hair loss, urticaria, erythema, pigmentation (bronzing) and sclerodema), the lungs (isolated cases), and the gastro-intestinal tract (nausea and vomiting). <br/><br/>The results of this study serve as a completion of the data base concerning safety and tolerance of treosulfan within the framework of general regulatory requirements after being approved (Safety-Update).;Recruiting complete, follow-up complete;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;http://www.drks.de//drks_web/navigate.do?navigationId=trial.HTML&TRIAL_ID=DRKS00003943;2017-12-08T11:03:57.552+01:00;;Freiburg;FALSE;

Subjects will be visited at home together with caregivers and relatives by an experienced geriatric psychiatrist and members of the residential dementia network. In addition to a preliminary diagnostic assessment the caregivers and relatives will be informed on specific institutional and non-institutional support. Primary aim is to integrate subjects into a residential network and to facilitate domestic care as long as possible. ;Anosognosia is a common symptom in dementia, covering a wide spectrum from loss of insight till denial of illness. Anosognosia has significant impact on the course of the disease and is associated with unfavourable outcome. Due to unawareness the patient is not able to initiate medical evaluation and to accept diagnostic procedures or medical treatment. Thus, patients are not integrated into psycho-social networks and medical support. This has significant impact on patient-centered-care in a domestic  environment. <br/><br/>New strategies are required to cope with anosognosia in patients with dementia and their caregivers. Medical advice and home-counseling need to be developed for the German Health Care System as a tool for low-threshold-approach. The scientific aim of the current investigation is the evaluation of interventions to integrate patients with dementia and anosognosia into the existing residential facilities for patients with dementia. Study population  are patients with dementia and significant unawareness as well as caregivers or other  relatives of subjects, who had denied  to join medical evaluation deliberately till now. Subjects are visited at home assisted by caregivers and relatives.<br/><br/>Aims of the study:<br/>1. Describing a subgroup of patients with dementia and anosognosia, which has not received much interest in previous scientific work until today.<br/>2.

So far, many survivors of CAN have untreated mental health problems, although there are proven treatments. Untreated trauma-related mental disorders put significant burden on the individual and produce considerable costs for the society. Therefore a group of researchers from child and adolescent psychology and psychiatry developed the CANMANAGE project to combine an intervention that aims to improve access to proven treatments for those CAN survivors. The study enrols 152 CAN victims aged 4-17 years and their non-offending caregivers at four German communities. Efforts will be directed to include children known to be on elevated risk for mental disorder due to CAN, such as foster children, children in group homes, or children from migrant families. All study participants receive a thorough assessment of their trauma history and their current mental health state. It is planned to test the effectiveness of a specialized intervention model (case management) to improve access and adherence to proven treatments. A case manager will help those children in need and their families to find the right treatment and to accomplish the treatment successfully. Comparisons to children who do not receive the assistance by a case manager will demonstrate whether the intervention aimed at improving timely utilization of mental healthcare is effective. ;Victims of Child Abuse and Neglect (CAN) have an elevated risk to develop mental disorders. To date, many survivors of CAN suffer from untreated mental health disorders, although there are evidence based therapy options available. The case-management intervention study is a prospectively designed, multicenter, randomized controlled trial investigating the effect of a case-management intervention on the utilization of evidence-based treatments. The objective of the CANMANAGE consortium is to reduce the time span in which mental health disorders related to trauma remain untreated. The study will recruit 152 children and adolescents aged 4-17 years with substantiated history of CAN or witnessing parental violence who have a mental disorder that can be diagnosed and classified according to the ICD-10. Participant will be randomized to the case-management intervention or the treatment as usual control condition in equal numbers. A case-manager is informed about possible access to health-care providers in his or her region and has received training in placing a child in an appropriate therapy program and monitor therapy outcome. Participants randomized to the control condition will receive what is currently the standard treatment for children with CAN. All participants will receive a thorough clinical assessment and re-assessment when they are first recruited as well as 6, 12 and 24 months after the initial assessment. Details about the exact CAN history will be collected. The primary outcome will be the amount of children placed in evidence-based therapy (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence Guidelines or American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry Guidelines).

Possible complications are undetected excess cement in the periimplant soft tissue and loss of retention of the crown. Abutments are titanium cylinders which are screwed into the implant and simulate the prepared tooth stump. On this abutment the crown can be fixed. Today different kinds of abutments are used. This clinical study compares standard and individual abutments. The primary outcome is to examine the undetected excess cement on both abutments after 2 weeks. Secondary outcomes are the examination of the periimplant soft tissue for volumetric changes or signs of inflammation. Cases of loss of retention will also be documented. To secure a high scientific informatic value the abutment will be randomized, what means that the choice which abutment is used will be at random.  ;Inflammatory destruction of the periimplant bone (periimplantitis) is the most common reason for late implant loss. For implants supporting cemented suprastructures, a possible reason is the presence of undetected excess cement in the periimplant soft tissue, especially when standard abutments are used, when the cement gap is subgingival. Individual abutments might not face this problem, because the cement cap can be constructed so it is cleanable, but no data are yet available. This pilot study will be conducted on 20 patients, comparing standard and individual abutments. The primary endpoint of the pilot study is to quantify undetected excess cement on standard and individual abutments with implant-supported single crowns after two weeks. In addition, the periimplant soft tissue will be examined for volumetric changes or signs of inflammation, and cases of loss of retention will also be documented. All working steps in fabrication of the implant-supported single crowns will be performed by one dentist and one dental technician only. A randomization will be performed and all investigations in the study will be performed by two calibrated investigators who did not participate in the dental treatment at any time. The Institute of Medical Biometry and Informatics (IMBI) of the University of Heidelberg will be involved in the study. <br/>The aetiology of periimplantitis is numerous and mostly unknown, and the incidence is increasing drastically. This pilot study will enable precise calculation of sample size for a main study. The purpose of the main study will be to formulate precise recommendations for treatment which enable undetected excess cement in the peri-implant soft tissue, a possible aetiological factor of periimplantitis, to be avoided.<br/>;Recruiting complete, follow-up complete;Paper;b673ca41-a9ae-4e90-98b3-a56801b09841;Residual Cement 2015.pdf;Undetected residual cement on standard or individualized all-ceramic abutments with cemented zirconia single crowns – a prospective randomized pilot trial;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;http://www.drks.de//drks_web/navigate.do?navigationId=trial.HTML&TRIAL_ID=DRKS00004158;2019-11-05T11:20:04.031+01:00;;Heidelberg;FALSE;

One of the underlying reasons might be the lack of adequate treatment options. <br/>In this multicenter study, we aim to test a new, low key group intervention focusing on improving compliance and psychosocial functioning. The study is a subproject of the Medical and psychosocial implications of adolescent extreme obesity – acceptance and effects of structured care, short: ""Youth with Extreme obesity Study (YES)”, which aims at improving the medical care and social support structures for youth with obesity and extreme obesity in Germany. <br/>Obese youth and young adults (BMI ≥ 30kg/m2) between the ages of 14 and 24.9 years (21 years initially) are eligible to participate. Participants will be asked to complete a series of questionnaires on their general health, psychosocial situation and wellbeing, and will be offered a thorough medical evaluation. Individuals who complete the baseline evaluations will be invited to participate in 6 group sessions over a 3 months period. Group assignment to the psycho-social intervention vs. routine care group will be at random, like throwing a dice. After 6 months, participants will complete further questionnaires to evaluate the effects of the interventions on quality of life and psycho-social functionning.<br/><br/>The study will show the acceptance and effectiveness of a new intervention focusing on improving compliance and psychosocial functioning in adolescents with extreme obesity, and thereby inform the development of new treatment and support options for these adolescents. If interested, participants are invited to participate in additional components of YES, and to receive medical care and psycho-social support.<br/>In February 2013 an amendment was added to the study to include patients up till 24.9 years. <br/>";"While obese youth are at high risk for co-morbidities, especially the extremely obese individuals rarely seek medical care. The underlying reasons are poorly understood, but patient inherent factors and the lack of adequate treatment options may play a role. <br/>In this multicenter study, we aim to assess the acceptance and effectiveness of a manual based low key group intervention focusing on improving compliance and psychosocial functioning in adolescents with morbid obesity (BMI≥35kg/m2), in comparison to routine care. Youth with more moderate degrees of obesity (BMI 30-34.9kg/m2) will serve as an additional control group. The study is part of the Medical and psychosocial implications of adolescent extreme obesity - acceptance and effects of structured care, short: ""Youth with extreme obesity Study (YES)"", which also comprises the recruitment and characterization of obese (BMI 30-34.9kg/m2) and extremely obese (BMI ≥ 35kg/m2) youth from different healthcare- and non healthcare settings, a structured prospective evaluation of adolescent bariatric surgery, economic assessments of the financial burden of extreme adolescent obesity on the healthcare system, and a long-term prospective observation study.<br/><br/><br/>Based on the current state of knowledge, we will test the a priori ordered hirarchy of hypotheses:<br/>1. The compliance rate 6 months after randomization is higher in subjects in the low key intervention group compared to the standard care group.<br/>2. Covariant-adjusted changes in quality of life (assessed by DISABKIDS scale) between baseline and the 6 months follow up will be more pronounced in the low key intervention group compared to the standard care group.<br/><br/>The five participating university centers are distributed across 4 geographic regions in the North (Berlin), in the West (Essen/Datteln), in the East (Leipzig) and in the South (Ulm) of Germany, and will therefore render data that are representative of Germany as a whole. We will screen a 600 adolescents age 14 to 24.9 years (21 years initially) with extreme obesity (BMI ≥ 35 kg/m2) and 600 adolescents with obesity (BMI 30-34.9 kg/m2) over a 24 months period. A total of 350 subjects will be enrolled. Baseline assessments include an array of standardized questionnaires and validated instruments to assess health, psycho-social situation, psychiatric co-morbidities and health related quality of life, as well as an in-depth medical evaluation.  Individuals who complete the baseline evaluations will be invited to participate in 6 group sessions over a 3 months period. Group assignment to the low key intervention vs. standard care group will be at random. The effects of the interventions on health related quality of life and psycho-social functioning  will be assessed via questionnaires after 6 months.

To reduce possible disadvantages for especially patients with morbid obesity, it seems sensible on account of the first clinical results to adapt the mechanical ventilation to the situation of the individual patient. For example, the respiration pressure for the mechanical ventilation can be selected exactly by this adaptation which is neither too high (danger of the overexpansion or even the rupture of alveolus) nor too low (danger of the collapse of alveolus).  <br/>From this individualized adaptation of respiration by electric impedance tomography we hope for the confirmation of the advantages on the function of the lung and the other organs after the operation. Furthermore we examine whether the duration of stay on the intensive care unit and the whole hospitalisation can be reduced.;This clinical trial is a prospective, randomised, controlled pilot study for comparison of two different artificial ventilation strategies during the anaesthesia. The adaptation of the mechanical ventilation occurs through PEEP-Titration by means of electric impedance tomography. Primary aim is the investigation whether by use of individualised intraoperative lung-protective ventilation during anaesthesia the postal-surgical oxygenation and inspiratory oxygen fraction can be improved significantly. <br/>Secondary end points are the final expiratory lung volume, postal-surgical pulmonary and non- pulmonary organ function (on the basis of the sofa score), the incidence of pulmonary and non- pulmonary complications as well as the length of stay in the intensive care unit and in hospital.;Recruiting complete, follow-up complete;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;http://www.drks.de//drks_web/navigate.do?navigationId=trial.HTML&TRIAL_ID=DRKS00004199;2018-04-18T09:34:49.290+02:00;;Leipzig;FALSE;

They are only insufficiently reached by existing health offers. In the study, culture-sensitive patient information was developed. It was examined whether culture-sensitive patient information has a higher subjective value than standard-translated information. Patients with a Turkish, Polish, Russian or Italian migration background with a diagnosis of depressive disorder or chronic low back pain were included in the study. The study provides an empirically tested answer to the question of whether culture-sensitive patient information is evaluated as more useful by<br/>migrants than translated information materials without cultural adaptation.;"Background:<br/>Of the approx. 15 million persons with a migration background living in Germany (19% of the population), many are only insufficiently reached by existing health offers. In the literature, the necessity for culturally adapted information materials for patients with a migration background is often cited as a method for improving health care.<br/>Aim and research question:<br/>In the study, culture-sensitive patient information was developed and evaluated for patients with a migration background and chronic disease (depression or chronic low back pain). In this respect, it was examined whether culture-sensitive patient information has a higher subjective usefulness than standard-translated information.<br/>Methods:<br/>The implementation and evaluation of culture-sensitive patient information took place in the framework of a double-blind randomised-controlled study in four study centres (Freiburg/Lörrach; Leipzig; Hamburg; Oberhausen/Mülheim/Duisburg) with patients with a Turkish, Polish, Russian or Italian migration background with a diagnosis of depressive disorder or chronic low back pain. In the intervention group, culture-sensitive patient information was handed out to the patient within the physician consultation. In the control group, standard-translated patient information was applied. The patients were surveyed by means of nationally and internationally established, language- and culture-adapted questionnaires following the index consultation (T0) as well as after 8 weeks (T1) and 6 months (T2). In this respect, besides the measurement of the primary dependent variable (subjective usefulness), data on secondary dependent variables was also gathered. Additionally, the GPs were surveyed with regard to the practical relevance of culture-sensitive patient information.<br/>Implementation:<br/>At the beginning of the project, the disease-specific patient information on depression and chronic low back pain were developed and translated into the target languages.

According to international guidelines the treatment of these patients requires an integrative therapy, which is tailored to their complex needs. Such specific programs, that pursue an integrative therapy of addiction and the consequences of trauma, have proved of value in the US. However, respective offers have to date not been commonly available in Germany. In particular, there are no tested interventions existent, which are adapted to the demands outpatient addiction treatment. The study therefore aims at testing the effectiveness of the “Seeking Safety” therapy program (Najavits 2002, 2008), a specific treatment for addict patients with posttraumatic disorders (PTSD). Female patients with PTSD and substance-dependence will be included in the study. The central questions are whether this specific treatment in the sense of its objective leads to improved posttraumatic stress symptoms as well as reduced substance use, and how its effectiveness is to be assessed compared to other interventions. ;"PTSD is a frequent comorbidity among individuals with childhood abuse and SUD. In German samples of patients with SUD, the prevalence of current PTSD, which is in most cases related to childhood abuse, is 15-30%, (Schäfer et al. 2007, Driessen et al. 2008). Higher rates of PTSD are found in female patients as compared to males (25%-50%). According to international guidelines, integrated treatment is necessary to meet the complex needs of these patients. In Europe, no evaluated treatments for individuals with PTSD and SUD are available yet, representing a substantial gap in the provision of services for victims of CAN. “Seeking Safety“ (Najavits 2002), a manualised, cognitive-behavioural treatment, has been shown to be effective in several studies in the United States. The manual has been published in German (www.trauma-und-sucht.de). A pilot trial showed good feasibility and acceptance, and a high retention rate (85%) in N=38 female victims of childhood abuse with PTSD and SUD (Schäfer et al. 2010b). As a basis for the dissemination of the program, however, its efficacy needs to be replicated under the conditions of the German health care system. The aim of the study is to test the efficacy of a standardised cognitive-behavioural group therapy (“Seeking Safety”) in female adults with SUD and PTSD in a randomized-controlled trail. In international studies, the program has consistently proven superior efficacy compared to the treatment usually offered by substance abuse services (TAU), and non-inferiority compared to other standard CBT-interventions. Standardised CBT interventions are not commonly applied in German SUD outpatient services. Nevertheless, the program will be tested against a standardised relapse prevention training (S.T.A.R.; Körkel & Schindler 2003).";Recruiting complete, follow-up complete;Paper;[---]*;[---]*;"Schäfer I, Lotzin A, Hiller P, Sehner S, Driessen M, Hillemacher T, Schäfer M, Scherbaum N, Schneider B & Grundmann J (2019) A multisite randomized controlled trial of Seeking Safety vs. Relapse Prevention Training for women with co-occurring posttraumatic stress disorder and substance use disorders.

The treatment intensification is stratified according to the age of the patient. The induction therapy consists of all-trans-retinoic acid (Vesanoid®) 45 mg/m²/day and simultaneous chemotherapy with TAD. The second induction cycle, HAM with high dose cytarabine (ara-C) is scheduled at day 21 after the start of TAD, independent of the recovery of peripheral blood counts. In elderly patients aged over 60 years the second induction cycle (HAM with reduced ara-C-dose) is at the discretion of the treating physician. ATRA is continued until complete hematological remission or for a maximum of 90 days. Details of therapy: TAD: 6-thioguanine (6-TG) 100 mg/m² orally every 12 hours (h), days 3-9, ara-C 100 mg/m² by continuous intravenous (i.v.) infusion, days 1-2, thereafter 100 mg/m² as i.v. infusion every 12h, days 3-8, daunorubicin (DNR) 60 mg/m² i.v. infusion, days 3-5.

Another important result of the studies showed, that only patients who had reached a molecular remission (no persistence of leukemic cells can be found using highly sensitive molecular tests) achieved durable remission and cure. <br/>In the present study, patients with newly diagnosed APL are randomly (distribution by chance) assigned to two established treatment concepts, which are compared. In both concepts chemotherapy is combined with ATRA.<br/>The available study results show, that the concept of the German AMLCG (Acute Myeloid Leukemia Cooperative Group) is highly efficient, but relatively toxic. The data further show that the patients may reach the molecular remission relatively fast. In contrast, the treatment of the Spanish Study Group (PETHEMA) seems to be less toxic, but showed more relapses, and the molecular remission seems to be reached later. <br/>In the present study, the molecular kinetics of the leukemic cell burden and the rates of hematological (no leukemia seen by microscopy) and molecular remissions should be compared in both arms.

Metformin is a drug that is used for treatment of so called adult onset diabetes. Both metformin and trimethoprim are frequently used drugs, and trimethoprim possibly influences the behaviour (drug concentrations and effect) of metformin in the body.<br/><br/>Potential participants: Healthy adult male and female subjects.<br/><br/>Outcomes: The effect of trimethoprim on concentrations of metformin in blood and urine and therewith on the effects of metformin shall be investigated.<br/><br/>The hypothesis is: We suspect that trimethoprim influences the concentrations of metformin in blood and urin and therewith the therapeutic effects of metformin. Possibly, the extent of this interaction may be influenced by the genes. This means, that the extent of the interaction may vary from person to person depending on the genes.;Both metformin and trimethoprim are frequently used drugs. We hypothesize that trimethoprim influences both pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of metformin. Furthermore, we hypothesize that the extent of this interaction is influenced by genetic variants. ;Recruiting stopped after recruiting started ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;http://www.drks.de//drks_web/navigate.do?navigationId=trial.HTML&TRIAL_ID=DRKS00004349;2014-03-27T12:02:46.522+01:00;;Erlangen;FALSE;

Anxiety reactions are generally harmless, but often associated with physical ailments (including heart palpitations, trembling, shortness of breath). For this reason many patients mistakenly believe that they were physically ill. Anxiety disorders can strongly interfere with work life and personal relationships, thereby leading to high emotional distress and considerable costs to society.<br/>In a third of cases the anxiety disorder is treated exclusively by the family doctor. Not less than 5 percent of the patients in a German family practice suffer from the specific anxiety disorders ""Panic Disorder"" and ""Agoraphobia"". The goal of the ""Jena-Paradies”-study is to develop and test practice team-supported training program for these primary care patients. As part of the ""Jena-Paradies"" training program, patients will firstly learn to understand the anxiety disorder. The family doctor will then provide patients with a number of behavioral therapy-oriented tasks (exercises). These well-proven exercises have already helped many other patients to overcome their anxiety disorder. During the whole treatment patients will be accompanied and supported by the family doctor and by one of his health care assistants. They both form the practice team. A number of well-structured personal appointments and telephone contacts between the patient and the practice team will take place. Additionally patients will receive a self-help manual to support the training program.<br/>It is expected that there will be greater decreases in anxiety symptoms when patients are treated by means of the ""Jena-Paradies” training program as if they are treated by the family doctor “as usual”. To scientifically test this expectation two groups of participating family practices will be created during the course of the study: One group will treat the patients by means of the ""Jena-Paradies"" training program and the other will treat them as usual (without using the training program). Within the course of twelve months, all patients will be asked about their health per questionnaire at three timepoints. The two groups will be statistically compared in terms of patient health and treatment costs.<br/>";"Background: <br/>Panic disorder (ICD-10: F41.0) is a widespread anxiety disorder which is characterized by repeated panic attacks, where strong but harmless physical symptoms occur (like dizziness, chest pain, weakness, tremors, sweating or shortness of breath). Often sufferers do not know what is happening to them during panic attacks, for which reason they erroneously worry about being physically ill or ""getting crazy"". Above all, they fear that panic attacks are going to occur again. Due to this fear many of them start to avoid certain places or situations where they feel uncomfortable or are afraid to become anxious. This kind of avoidance behavior is called Agoraphobia (ICD-10: F 40.0). Agoraphobia is comorbid to Panic Disorder in 35-65 % of cases. Usually both disorders strongly interfere with work life and personal relationships, thereby leading to high emotional distress and considerable costs to society. At the same time evidence-based, effective treatment options are available.<br/>The “Jena-Paradies”-study is aimed at facilitating the treatment of panic disorder and agoraphobia in primary care as most of the patients are treated by family doctors. The primary treatment of anxiety disorders by means of behaviour-therapy-oriented procedures is recommended by international clinical guidelines (e.g. APA 2009, DGPPN 2000). Additionally, it has been shown that the treatment of chronic diseases can be optimized by methods derived from the Chronic Care Model. In line with this, a practice team-supported, self-managed exposure training for Panic Disorder and Agoraphobia in primary care will be evaluated by the ""Jena-Paradies""-study. This training incorporates the recommended behavior therapy-oriented procedures and is carried out in terms of a practice team-based Case Management.<br/><br/>Objectives: Comparing a practice team-supported, self-directed exposure training for panic disorder with/without agoraphobia in ambulant primary care patients to ""Usual Care"" plus recommended standard in terms of clinical effectiveness and health economic costs.<br/><br/>Methods: This is a prospective, controlled two-armed, multi-centered, cluster-randomized interventional trial. Family practices will be assigned to the study arms following a computer supported randomization. 444 participants (observational units) from 74 family practices (Clusters) shall be included. Recruitment of patients will be carried out by the participating family practices.<br/>All participating investigators (general practitioners, GPs) will be trained in evidence based diagnostics and treatment of panic disorder with or without agoraphobia in accordance to recommended standards (DGPPN 2000).<br/>In the intervention arm of the study practice teams (i.e. the GP and one of his health care assistants, HCA) will additionally be trained in applying the practice team-supported, self-directed exposure training (i.e. the “Jena-Paradies” training program). The ""Jena-Paradies"" training program will be carried out in terms of a practice team-based Case Management. It includes the treatment elements counseling, psychoeducation, instructions for confrontation in vivo, and self-help manual. The treatment plan will comprise manualized behavior therapy oriented GP-consultations as well as protocol based HCA-telephone contacts. Anxiety symptoms and treatment progress will be monitored by the HCA using a special monitoring checklist (JA-MoL) during periodical telephone contacts. JA-MoL results will be reported to the GP who will be able to adjust treatment decisions according to them. In the control arm of the study GPs will provide patients with usual care in accordance to recommended standards. Treatment duration will be six months per patient.<br/><br/>Outcomes: <br/>Outcome measurements will be carried out by questionnaires (patient self-report) at measurement points T0 (baseline before treatment start), T1 (26 +/- 4 weeks after baseline), and T2 (52 +/- 4 weeks after baseline). Estimation and significance testing of the baseline adjusted mean outcome group differences at T1 will be carried out by fitting a mixed linear model. Data of all patients will be analyzed in terms of an Intent-to-Treat analysis. Estimation and significance testing of treatment effects on secondary endpoints will be carried out by fitting mixed linear or generalized mixed linear models as appropriate.<br/><br/><br/>";Recruiting complete, follow-up complete;Paper;[---]*;http://trialsjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1745-6215-15-112;Study Protocol;Further trial documents;61a2daf6-5991-4ace-bf70-a062e9053175;Jena-PARADIES_Studienprotokoll-Poster.pdf;Poster des Studienprotokolls;Further trial documents;c2766d69-6871-484d-a133-46fdde6de199;2012_Jena-PARADIES_DerHausarzt16.pdf;"Artikel in ""Der Hausarzt"" (2012)";Further trial documents;27c19706-01ff-4c6a-a7f4-5f5a2731e99f;2013_Jena-PARADIES_BayrAerzteblatt.pdf;"Artikel im ""Bayerischen Ärzteblatt"" (2013)";;;;;http://www.drks.de//drks_web/navigate.do?navigationId=trial.HTML&TRIAL_ID=DRKS00004386;2016-10-06T11:07:29.408+02:00;;Jena;FALSE;

However a reasonable amount of patients complains of postoperative problems. One of the main causes is anterior knee pain which can be found in up to 24% of the patients according to literature (Li S, Int. Orthop 2011). The cause of anterior knee pain is an irregular patellofemoral tracking with a medialized or lateralized course of the patella due to an insufficient reconstruction of the capsule. This contributes to increased patellar tilt, patellar translation and increased retropatellar pressure which is the underlying cause of anterior knee pain. <br/>In this prospective study we want to focus on anterior knee pain, patellar tilt and patellar translation after tka with or without augmented reconstruction of the medial patellofemoral ligament.;Examination of patellar tilt, patellar translation and length of mpfl after total knee arthroplasty with or without augmented reconstruction of the mpfl;Recruiting complete, follow-up complete;Abstract;[---]*;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28493040;Stability of capsule closure and postoperative anterior knee pain after medial parapatellar approach in TKA;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;http://www.drks.de//drks_web/navigate.do?navigationId=trial.HTML&TRIAL_ID=DRKS00004513;2017-06-13T12:44:54.244+02:00;;Regensburg;FALSE;

Adolescents will be recruited directly via rehabilitation hospitals, and will then be randomized to a study and a control group. Control group: No intervention, medical care as usual. The intervention consists of a six month telephone counseling through trained prevention managers in order to maintain BMI-SDS-reduction achieved during the inpatient obesity therapy.

Prior to the intervention, participating adolescents will be asked to provide information on socio-demography, psychosocial status, daily physical activity and leisure time habits as well as on eating behavior.;Maintenance approaches in adolescent obesity are scarce today. To our knowledge, no obesity intervention study for children and adolescents has examined the impact of telephone counseling as an aftercare weight maintenance approach. Thus, the present study aims to evaluate a) the feasibility and b) the efficacy of a six month aftercare weight maintenance treatment (maintaining BMI-SDS, i.e. standard deviation score of body mass index) following reconvalescent care for adolescent obesity based on telephone counseling, with a follow up period of two years.<br/>Adolescents (14-18 years) will be recruited directly via rehabilitation hospitals, and will then be randomized to an intervention and a control group (RCT).

Such intergenerational transmission of adverse experiences has been observed by clinicians and other health professionals. It is assumed that, in such case, the parenting abilities are fundamentally disturbed, because these mothers have experienced physical and sexual abuse or neglect mainly by their own caregivers. Further investigation of the transmission of abuse is needed to understand its underlying mechanisms and to design successful intervention and prevention programs.<br/>The present project not only seeks to understand this so-called “cycle of abuse” but aims at evaluating therapeutic interventions to break this vicious circle.  <br/>In this multi-center study, mothers with a history of sexual of physical abuse in childhood together with their children in middle childhood (5-12 years) will be included. The project focuses on the mothers’ and their children’s mental health as well as on mother-child interactions. In the study, different methods will be used: We will observe behavior, conduct psychological tests, and provide questionnaires. Furthermore, hormonal levels (i.e., the stress hormone cortisol) will be assessed, genetic and epigenetic analyses will be conducted, and the mothers’ brains will be looked at (by) using brain-imaging techniques (fMRI).    <br/>A further goal of the study is to find intervention programs that can improve mother-child interactions. 120 mother-child dyads with and 120 dyads without a history of adverse life events will take part in a baseline diagnostic investigation. After this, 120 mothers with a history of adverse life events (60 mothers of the Heidelberg subproject and 60 mothers of the Berlin subproject) and their children will be randomized to either a Parent-Child-Interaction-Therapy (PCIT) or dose-matched individual stress management training for mothers (each comprised of 12 weekly sessions). While the Parent-Child-Interaction-Therapy includes coaching of the mother with respect to the mother-child interaction, the second intervention program, a stress-management training, improves maternal stress coping strategies. The intervention groups will be compared regarding maternal sensitivity, maternal abuse potential, child mental health, and quality of life immediately after the intervention and 6 months later.;Given the high prevalence of mothers with a history of adverse experiences who show dysfunctional patterns in the interaction with their own children, a better understanding of the intergenerational transmission of abuse is urgently needed. Moreover, it is of crucial importance to evaluate effective interventions to stop this vicious cycle. The aim of the study is to investigate dysfunctional interactions of traumatized mother-child dyads by combining basic neurobiological research with randomized controlled intervention trials. The project focuses on the dyadic interaction by investigating (1) the behavioural and (neuro)biological correlates of maternal sensitivity, affect regulation and child abuse potential, i.e. neural mechanisms, hormones and (epi-)genetics and (2) the impact of maternal behaviour and characteristics on her child’s well-being including its emotional and cognitive development. <br/>This multicentre study includes mothers with and without a history of physical or sexual abuse in their own childhood and their 5-to 12-year old children. 120 mother-child dyads with a history of maternal abuse and non-optimal maternal sensitivity will be included in a randomized therapy study (N=60 in Heidelberg and N=60 in Berlin). The aim of this randomized control trial is to compare the effectiveness of an intervention program with a specific focus on mother-child interaction (parent-child-interaction-therapy, PCIT) with a non-dyadic treatment (maternal stress management training). More precisely, the intervention groups will be compared regarding maternal sensitivity, maternal abuse potential, child mental health and quality of life immediately after the intervention and 6 months later. <br/>;Recruiting complete, follow-up complete;Paper;[---]*;[---]*;"Maternal sensitivity and the empathic brain: Influences of early life maltreatment.

The laparoscopic method uses small skin incisions to introduce operational instruments and a camera into the abdomen and to conduct the operation. The patient benefits from this procedure in terms of, among others, reduced post-operative pain and reduced consumption of analgesics, faster mobilisation, reduced risk of infection, and faster return to ordinary life including earlier leave from hospital. The cosmetic results are excellent due to minimal abdominal incisions and minimal entry sites for operational instruments. However, surgeons face higher psychomotor demands by comparison to procedures involving open incisions. Hence, regular and safe laparoscopic practice involving a specific training curriculum outside of the operating theatre is essential. To this end, the Heidelberg University Medical Centre established the MIS training centre which was equipped with different training devices enabling prospective surgeons to acquire the motor abilities and operational processes necessary before applying them to actual patients. Part of the training centre equipment is a box trainer which may be used to acquire basic skills in the use of operational instruments which may then be used to proceed to more complex operational sequences. Moreover, a virtual reality trainer produced by Simbionix (“Lap Mentor”) and functioning as a laparoscopic simulator enables both practicing basic skills and procedural steps in surgery, and learning how to conduct more complex operational sequences.

Due to mental disorders requiring hospitalization, oral hygiene becomes less important and sometimes neglected. This can cause various oral health problems as dental caries, gingivitis, disturbed tooth eruption and infections.<br/>After oral examination by dentist and assessing the individual Caries risk, patient’s oral hygiene habits are recorded by especially developed questionnaire and the oral health related quality of life with an standardizes questionnaire. Oral hygiene is recorded at the beginning and at the end of the hospitalization period by measuring the distribution of dental plaque. Patients are divided into two groups, test and control. Patients of the test group receive individual advice and recommendations of suitable oral hygiene measures and hands-on-training provided by dentists at first examination visit. Suitable methods and use of supplementary devices are trained and patients are motivated to clean mouth and teeth on a regular basis. Patients of the control group receive those recommendation and training at last examination visit.<br/>The hypothesis that patients hospitalized in children’s psychiatric clinic can improve their oral hygiene after professional advice and hands-on-training of individually adapted measures and methods will be tested.<br/>;Background: Due to affected mental health of patients hospitalized in children’s psychiatric clinic, oral hygiene is getting less important during hospitalization and occasionally neglected. Deterioration of oral health and oral health related quality of life can occur.<br/>The aim of this study is to evaluate and to improve the oral health status, oral hygiene and oral health related quality of life of patients hospitalized in children’s psychiatric clinic.<br/>Material and Methods: 74 patients hospitalized in the children’s psychiatric clinic of the University Hospital Jena between 6 and 18 years of age are included. Patients are divided into two groups, test and control, by random using a randomization tool.<br/>The first oral examination is taking place short time after admission to hospital. Dental status and periodontal health status are recorded as well as oral hygiene status using Turesky-Index. The individual caries risk is assessed with a standard test. Oral hygiene habits are investigated by especially developed questionnaire and oral health related quality of life by standardizes and validated questionnaire CPQ-G11-14. To the patients of the test group are recommended individualized oral hygiene measures and methods according to the requirements and competencies by dentists. Those methods, including the use of auxiliary devices are exercised in hands-on-training provided by dentists. Patients are motivated to clean their mouth and teeth on a regular basis, using the recommended methods. Patients of the control group receive individualized recommendation and practical training at the last examination, taking place short time before discharge from the hospital. Oral hygiene is assessed at the last examination visit before and after cleaning the mouth by the patient itself.<br/>Data regarding oral health, oral hygiene and oral health related quality of life are analyzed taking into consideration the limitations caused by mental disorders.<br/>The hypothesis that patients hospitalized in children’s psychiatric clinic can improve their oral hygiene after professional advice and hands-on-training of individually adapted measures and methods will be tested.<br/>;Recruiting complete, follow-up complete;Abstract;3407991f-000f-425b-9349-956e5caa01bc;OH+OHRQoL-KJP-Fin.pdf;Oral Health and Oral Health related Quality of Life in 6-17 year old psychiatric patients, Posterpresentation at EADPH Annual Congress, Istanbul;Abstract;d4619765-bac3-4c1f-9343-32f110f6cf76;OralHealth-CAPsych_ORCA2015.pdf;Caries Experience and Treatment Need among 6- to 17-year old Psychiatric Patients, Posterpresentation at ORCA Annual Congress, Brussel;;;;;;;;;;;;;http://www.drks.de//drks_web/navigate.do?navigationId=trial.HTML&TRIAL_ID=DRKS00004737;2015-10-09T16:29:28.086+02:00;;Jena;FALSE;

Low-dose IL-2 therapy of SLE aims to compensate the pre-existing IL-2 deficiency and thus to restore a physiological state. We hypothesize a beneficial effect of exogenously supplemented low-dose IL-2 on numbers, percentages, function, and phenotype of Treg and consequently a reduction in the disease activity in patients with active disease. Due to the low-dose regimen, clinical and cellular benefits can be achieved without eliciting relevant side effects. The study population will consist of 12 patients with the diagnosis of SLE  and increased disease activity despite treatment with at least two different standard immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory therapies.;PRO-IMMUN is a combined phase I/IIa, interventional, prospective, open-label, uncontrolled, single-center and investigator-initiated trial addressing the safety, tolerability, efficacy and immunological responses of a subcutaneous low-dose regimen with the interleukin-2 analogue Aldesleukin (Proleukin®) in patients with SLE and increased disease activity refractory to standard treatments.<br/>SLE is caused by a hyperactivity of the immune system at both a cellular<br/>and a humoral level. As a consequence, immunosuppressive therapies are used with potential harmful side effects that have emerged nowadays as leading factors for morbidity and mortality in SLE.<br/>Regulatory T cells (Treg) are natural barriers against autoimmunity by suppressing the activation and expansion of autoreactive T cells and other harmful cells. <br/>The survival, growth and homeostatic maintenance of Treg fundamentally depend on the availability of the cytokine IL-2. IL-2 deficiency results in a severe systemic autoimmune disease resembling SLE in many aspects. With regard to this, defects in IL-2 expression and Treg biology have been described to be present in murine and human SLE. Our previous studies in murine models of SLE provided a causal linkage between an acquired IL-2 deficiency, defects in Treg biology and the development of SLE. In addition, we demonstrated that compensation of the IL-2 deficiency by low-dose IL-2 therapy selectively corrects these Treg defects and ameliorates already established disease in these mice. In SLE patients, we found that Treg display similar phenotypic abnormalities than Treg from lupus and IL-2 deficient mice, pointing to a relevant IL-2 deprivation of Treg also in human SLE patients. These findings in conjunction with recent publications demonstrating selective Treg expansion and clinical improvement by a low-dose IL-2 therapy in two different immune-mediated diseases provide strong rationales for an IL-2-based immunotherapy of SLE in order to restore Treg-mediated tolerance. In these diseases, IL-2 deficiency has not been described. It is therefore hypothesized that the effect of IL-2 therapy would be even more pronounced in SLE, where IL-2 deficiency plays an important role in disease pathogenesis.<br/>High-dose IL-2 therapy is currently approved for the therapy of metastatic renal cell carcinoma and malignant melanoma with the rationale to broadly stimulate the anti-tumor activity of T and NK cells. In contrast to this, low-dose IL-2 therapy aims to selectively enhance Treg activity in order to re-establish endogenous mechanisms of tolerance that can counteract autoimmunity. Because Treg constitutively express the high-affinity IL-2-receptor, low-dose IL-2 therapy targets mainly the Treg population and therefore is suitable to selectively stimulate and expand the Treg population in vivo with little or no activation of other immune cells.<br/>Here we aim to conduct a combined phase I/IIa, prospective, open-label single-center, investigator-initiated trial addressing the safety, tolerability, clinical efficacy and immunological responses of a low-dose IL-2 therapy in patients with active SLE and who are refractory to standard therapies. Primary endpoints are safety, tolerability and the cellular response of the Treg population defined by an increase in the percentage of CD25++ cells among CD3+CD4+Foxp3+CD127lo Treg by at least 100% at week 9 compared to baseline at week 1. Secondary and exploratory endpoints include clinical efficacy and other immunological and cellular response parameters. An advanced monitoring of the phenotype, frequency and function of cells of the immune system, including high-throughput sequencing of the TCR repertoire and gene expression profiling, will accompany the clinical study.<br/>This study is focused on the implementation of a novel, innovative and selective therapeutic approach aiming to resurrect the natural barrier against autoimmunity in SLE. Compensation of the IL-2 deficiency and the related re-establishment of a functional Treg compartment represent a unique biological therapeutic approach, which directly interacts with pathophysiological mechanisms and which changes the therapeutic concept from broadly suppressing the hyperactivity of the immune system to an endogenous enrichment of cells which can counteract autoimmunity. In vivo expansion and modification of the Treg population by low-dose IL-2 could therefore provide a selective and physiological therapeutic strategy to control autoimmunity efficiently while avoiding side effects and morbidity that are associated with conventional immunosuppressive drugs. There are strong rationales coming from animal lupus models, from the careful examination of SLE patients, from studies with low-dose IL-2 in other human immune-mediated diseases without any known IL-2 deficiency, and finally from a pilot study with low-dose IL-2 in one SLE patient.<br/>This proof-of-concept study will provide a basis for larger clinical trials and support its application for further indications.;Recruiting complete, follow-up complete;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;http://www.drks.de//drks_web/navigate.do?navigationId=trial.HTML&TRIAL_ID=DRKS00004858;2016-11-22T13:16:06.984+01:00;;Berlin Kiel LÃ¼beck;FALSE;

Both, female and male patients aged eighteen or older and facing a planned tracheotomy within the context of the treatment of underlying conditions may be included in the study. After a tracheotomy, the nose is no longer able to perform its air humidification and warming function. To minimize complications after a tracheotomy, the most established technique is to use cold air humidification, by holding a mask in front of the tracheostoma. By using this method, problems that can occur after tracheotomy like infections, inflammations or the clogging of trachea can be minimized. However, to this day the clinical superiority of the high flow airway humidification systems’ effect on the ciliary beat function has not been proved.;For newly tracheotomized patients, several different possibilities of airway humidification exist. To minimize respiratory complications, the method most established is the cold air humidification, using an uphold mask in front of the tracheostoma. As there is no air warming, effects on the ciliary function can be suspected.  High flow air warming systems like the Fisher & Paykel Healthcare “Airvo” are said to compensate this disadvantage. To this day,  the clinical superiority of these high flow air warming systems in relation to the ciliary function has not been reviewed or verified. Since the ciliated cells are vital for a limited time even post extraction, the influence of such humidification systems may be examined by ex-vivo analysis without causing any discomfort to the patient. Therefore, tracheal mucosa brush cytology of ciliary carrying cells is taken via the tracheostoma and is transferred into the nutrient medium. Beating cilia may then be visualized using phase contrast microscopy with an attached high-speed digital camera. Furthermore, the necessary interventions at the tracheostma – like suctions, the number of tracheitis, as well as the subjective evaluation of afflictions – are detected by using counting lists and evaluation lists, as well as a questionnaire.;Recruiting complete, follow-up complete;Paper;[---]*;[---]*;"2017 Head & Neck; Heated air humidification versus cold air nebulization in newly tracheostomized patients; Richard Birk, Alexander Händel, Angela Wenzel, Benedikt Kramer  Christoph Aderhold Karl Hörmann Boris A.

As well the question is raised if they judge their own possibilities to return to their jobs better than before. <br/>Participants to the study are patients with diagnosis type II diabetes mellitus and / or adiposity staying at the clinic Niederrhein during the length of the study. <br/>For answering the issue of the study the patients are disposed to different groups by coincidence.  One group receives the planning-competence-training with follow-up care, the second group receives the planning-competence training without follow-up care, the third group receives lectures about health topics with a shorter follow-up care and the last group receives the treatment as usual preserved in the clinic.<br/>;Observations of the clinical daily grind point to the difficulties patients with type II diabetes mellitus and adiposity have with translating the clinically induced changes in lifestyle to their daily lives consistently. <br/>Missing strategies or self-control measures cause an insufficiently transfer of the learned strategies to daily life (cf. Kulzer, Krichbaum & Hermann, 2008). <br/>The planning-competence training is applied to teach skills which allude to concrete planning skills as well as to the ability to analyze problems in addition to the disease- related skills belonging to the TAU. <br/>The keynote of the study is teaching overarching skills by planning-comeptence training.<br/>Against this background the training of planning-competence is meant to alleviate changing lifestyle as change of dietary and exercise habits, return to work chances and therefore improve quality of life. <br/>The issue is approached by a randomized controlled trial (RCT). Planning-competence training and a telephone follow-up care lasting for six months is transmitted in the experimental condition. For controlling the side- effects three control groups are provided.  Planning-comptence training without follow-up care is preserved to control group 1. As a placebo condition control group 2 sustains lectures about health topics with placebo follow-up care.

Opioids are an import component of this pain ladder. The study drugs tilidine and tramadol are ranked among the mild opioids. Since decades both drugs are approved and commonly used in clinical practice. However both have been used randomly for the treatment of cancer pain for there are little studies comparing and quantifying effects and adverse reactions of both drugs directly. This is what our study is aiming for. Especially the occurrence of sickness, nausea and vomiting shall be compared. Furthermore other side effects and the analgesic effects of tilidine and tramadol are checked against each other.<br/>Study objective is to find the drug with less adverse effects to give an informed therapy recommendation. <br/>;The study is ment to compare the side effects of tilidine and tramadol in the treatment of cancer pain. Objective is to find the drug with the better side effects profile.<br/>Tilidine and tramadol have been used in clinical practice since the 1970s. But there are little studies comparing effects and adverse reactions of both drugs. <br/>Anyhow we expect clinical relevant differences - particularly regarding the side effect of sickness, nausea and vomiting.<br/>Therefor two hypotheses are established: 1) There is a difference between tilidine and tramadol regarding their nauseating and vomiting effects. 2) Tilidine and Tramadol show further differences in their side effects profile as well as in their analgesic effects. <br/>;Recruiting stopped after recruiting started ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;http://www.drks.de//drks_web/navigate.do?navigationId=trial.HTML&TRIAL_ID=DRKS00004909;2015-07-13T16:41:22.138+02:00;;Freiburg;FALSE;

Several studies until now have shown the many positive results of aerobic exercise in lowering blood pressure as well as in the control of other risk factors for cardiovascular disease. For patients with hypertension, regular physical activity of 30-45 minutes on most days of the week is recommended. In addition to the endurance training a slight isometric or strength training is recommended as a complementary measure by the European Society of Hypertension. During isometric training as well as during aerobic exercise it comes to a temporary increase in blood pressure, which returnes to normal after completion of the exercise. Some studies in recent years indicate a long term isometric ahndgrip exercise lowers blood pressure without a risk to the patient. Smaller studies from the past provide evidence that the reduction in blood pressure through this training is even more pronounced than that by endurance training. Patient with arterial hypertension will be recruited and in 3 groups randomised. In the first group patients do active handgrip training. Patients in the second group are doing aerobic exercise. The third group is the placebo handgrip group. Several examinations will take place at baseline and at the end of the trial in order to compare the cardiovascular effects of aerobic and isometric training.;The study investigates the cardiovascular effects of isometric handgrip exercise against the aerobic exercise in patients with arterial hypertension.<br/>Arterial hypertension is the most common internal medicine disease. Aerobic exercise is recommended as part of the general measures for the treatment of hypertension. Previous studies have shown a reduction in blood pressure of 5-10mmHg in response to endurance training. The isometric exercise was recommended in the last guidelines (ESC / ESH 2007) complementary to aerobic exercise. Increasing studies in recent years have demonstrated a blood pressure lowering effect of handgrip exercise (up to 13.5/6.1mmHg systolic/diastolic). Because of its simple realisation and the low costs, handgrip exercise is thought to be a therapy that has a similar to exercise training blood pressure lowering effect with a better patient compliance.<br/>A direct comparison of the cardiovascular effects of aerobic and isometric handgrip exercise does not exist until now.;Recruiting complete, follow-up complete;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;http://www.drks.de//drks_web/navigate.do?navigationId=trial.HTML&TRIAL_ID=DRKS00004911;2015-10-14T13:47:46.315+02:00;;Berlin Bochum;FALSE;

The intervention is offered in outpatient aftercare phase because of the arising supply requirements in this phase which is, for example, caused by shortening inpatient bed times. The major research issue is the examination of the short-term effects of the intervention for both target groups. Examined as target relevant aspects will be relevant aspects of patient competency, psychological well-being and quality of life. In addition, a paper-pencil evaluation of the process characteristics will be done. The trainers will be systematically trained before the intervention and supervised during the intervention to refer to their loyalty to the manual. The implementation of the study is based on a randomized controlled waiting group designs. Therefore the immediate group will be compared with the waiting group which receives the specific intervention program 6-8weeks later. Three data collection time-points are provided: T1 at baseline and before randomization, T2 directly after the intervention for the immediate group and in the corresponding interval for the waiting group and T3 directly after the intervention for the waiting group and in corresponding interval for the immediate group (6-8 weeks after their intervention).

For the future, the treatment can be more precisely targeted to the individual needs of patients through the study. In the long term, the study will help optimizing the treatment of patients with substance use disorders and make the treatment options for patients  more transparent.<br/><br/>Background:<br/>In Germany there is a well-developed and effective support system for patients with substance use disorders. However, the various managers, organizational barriers, or the many available different treatment options may complicate the decision for further treatment. In other countries, positive experiences have been made when the treatment recommendation was based on criteria such as the severity of dependence, social and professional environment, comorbid mental disorders or the number of previous treatments. These systematic recommendations will be adapted to the individual needs of the patient.<br/><br/>Method:<br/>After having given informed consent, patients take part in a 75-minute interview with the study staff. This interview occurs about one week after admission. Patients receive a questionnaire, which they can answer in about 30 minutes. It is about alcohol consumption and possible consequences of consumption for everyday life, both mental and physical healthas well as treatments the patients have been done. After the interview, patients are randomly assigned to one of two study conditions. In one condition, the patient may obtain a general feedback about the guided interview, the further treatment planning runs as it is usually the case in the clinic. In the second condition, the patient gets an additional appointment where he will be given a treatment recommendation, derived from the results of the interview. <br/>Six months after the first interview, patients are called and asked to participate in a 40-minute telephone follow-up interview by a study staff. This conversation is about what happened to the patient after treatment. Questions are asked about areas that they have discussed in the first interview. To participate in this second interview, the patient will receive an allowance of € 30.00.<br/><br/>Study participants:<br/>Patients with the primary diagnosis of alcohol dependence, which take par in a detoxification program, are eligible for the study. The patients shpuld have completed the physical detoxification, and have no serious cognitive deficits. Further treatment after withdrawal should not have been approved.<br/><br/>Objectives and hypotheses:<br/>The aim of the study is the testing of allocation recommendations that are derived from a diagnostic interview and to compare these recommendations with natural allocation decisions for patient outcomes (consumption days within the last 30 days and number of elevated drinking days (operationalized as ≥ 6 standard drinks per day)) and health economic costs.<br/>As hypotheses arise:<br/>• Patients in the intervention group show six months after the end of treatment less alcohol consumption days (percent days) than patients in the control group.<br/>• The cost of health care utilization are lower than in the patients of the control group, patients in the intervention group.;"Background:<br/>In the Netherlands, the entire substance use treatment system has been restructured in the last 10 years. Allocation guidelines were implemented with positive results. Treatment recommendations could be derived from these guidelines that based on the criteria severity of dependence, severity, psychiatric comorbidity, severity of social disintegration and number of previous drug treatments  (Merkx et al, 2007;, 2011). The allocation guidelines are based on the stepped-care principle, but also take into account criteria for the treatment needs of the client: four evidence-based, increasing in intensity treatment options can be derived, referred in the Dutch model as the level of care (LOC): outpatient short-term treatment (LOC 1), outpatient treatment (LOC 2), day hospital or inpatient (LOC 3) and long-term treatment (LOC 4). In order to capture the necessary guidelines for the allocation information systematically, a diagnostic interview, the Measurements in the Addictions for Triage and Evaluation (MATE; Schippers, 2010) was developed. In the Netherlands, both the MATE and the allocation guidelines have been implemented in almost all addiction services. There were positive results in terms of validity, cost-effectiveness and patient and practitioners acceptance (Merkx et al., 2011).<br/>The potential benefits of Allocation Guidelines for the German addiction have frequently been discussed (eg Schulte, Shepherd & Reimer, 2003). While there are findings for differential allocation, such as the rehabilitation management categories (RMK, Spyra et al, 2011), there is no cross allocation guideline. However, the Dutch algorithm can not be applied unchanged in Germany, because both addiction systems differ substantially. For example, there is no (explicit) classification of different treatment options in terms of treatment intensity, also the German addiction treatment is more decentralized. The selection and weighting of indication criteria for various treatment options remains vague. Thus, a preliminary allocation guideline for the German substance use system was developed in the first phase of the study. In the second phase of the study it will be examined how the provisional guideline optimizes the allocation processes in the treatment of alcohol-dependent patients after detoxification.<br/><br/>Method:<br/>The proposed project is the empirical testing of a newly developed allocation guideline for feasibility and impact on treatment success in patients after detoxification. The guideline is based on the assessment of disease-related characteristics that are elevated by using the MATE. As a result of the interview treatment recommendations can be made. The interview takes place after physical detoxification. To evaluate health economic costs, the Client sociodemographic and Service Receipt Inventory (CSSRI,. Chisholm et al, 2000) will be used and for the collection of health-related quality of life of the EQ-5D (Prieto et al, 2003) will be used. For the evaluating psychological aspects, the rehabilitation management category assessment will be applied (RMK; Sprya et al, 2011).<br/>The interviews are conducted by specially trained therapists and last for about 75 minutes. Completion of the RMK- questionnaire will take 30 minutes.<br/>The study is conducted as a randomized, controlled trial. Patients will be randomly assigned after completion of the interview either to intervention group or to control group. The computerized randomization is automatically, so that the interviewer at the end of the conversation gets a message indicating whether the patient belongs to the intervention or control group. Patients in the intervention group receive an additional appointment, a feedback session, in which the results of the interview and a treatment recommendation will be reported and discussed. The patients in the control group received a general outcome feedback on their problem areas and a recommendation to further treatment, as they are regularly discussed in the clinics, but not based on the MATE.<br/>For the second measurement time, 6 months after the end of treatment, patients are interviewed by telephone by an employee at the UKE with the MATE- outcome. This interview takes about 45 minutes. Similarly, the CSSRI and the EQ-5D will be used.<br/><br/>Anticipated results:<br/>In the present project an allocation guideline is checked for feasibility using the MATE. With this, patients in the intervention group after detoxification get recommendations for further treatment. A systematic and needs-based allocation of patients to further treatment has the potential to reduce long-term overuse, underuse and misuse. This may as well reduce costs in the health care system. Also, patients are spared treatments that do not meet their needs. The algorithm is designed to support practitioners thereby to derive treatment recommendations and to discuss those in a transparent manner with their patients. This in no way restricts the self-determination of the patient, but on the contrary increases the involvement of patients in the decision-making and their motivation for further treatment.<br/>The allocation guideline will be empirically tested for its feasibility. This is done in four different located hospitals. Through the inclusion of several federal states and carrier (University Hospital, Regional Council, district hospital) a higher external validity and thus generalizability is to be expected. A randomized controlled trial of allocation guidelines has not yet been done, hence valuable methodological insights for the potency testing of systematic allocation methods are expected.";Recruiting complete, follow-up complete;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;http://www.drks.de//drks_web/navigate.do?navigationId=trial.HTML&TRIAL_ID=DRKS00005035;2017-08-10T12:26:45.057+02:00;;Hamburg;FALSE;

Obese individuals often experience psychosocial impairments (e.g., stigmatization, negative social interactions, social withdrawal) that may interfere with the preservation of a healthy lifestyle required for long-term weight loss maintenance, however, these difficulties are frequently not addressed by current weight loss maintenance (WLM) treatments.<br/>A Social Facilitation Maintenance Treatment (SFM) was developed for children with obesity having undergone conservative WL treatment, in order to facilitate supportive social networks and to maximize long-term success of weight reduction. In obese children aged 7-12 years, the SFM treatment resulted in a significantly better WLM relative to a no-treatment control condition over a two-year follow-up. Evidence on the efficacy of such a program in adults with obesity is missing.<br/>This pilot study aims to investigate the feasibility and efficacy of SFM treatment for overweight and obese adults having undergone conservative WL treatment. The control intervention consists of the commonly offered treatment as usual at the Integrated Research and Treatment Center (IFB) AdiposityDiseases. The SFM and control intervention extend over four months. Patients will randomly be assigned to the treatment condition.<br/>Body weight and psychosocial measures will be assessed at pre-treatment, at post-treatment, and at six, twelve, and 24 months after the end of treatment. An ancillary study addressing associated physiological changes (e.g., in the immune system), involves blood sampling and additional questionnaires at pre-treatment and post-treatment. <br/><br/>The extension of trial participation per patient was approved with Amendment 01 on November 6th, 2013. The change of the trial acronym was reported to the EC in NOvember 2015.;"Data from meta-analyses suggest that most adult patients who have undergone weight loss (WL) treatment cannot maintain weight reduction in the long term.

In addition, an ancillary study serves to elucidate physiological correlates of behavior change. For example, changes in plasma level of pro-inflammatory cytokines will be assessed longitudinally in order to examine their role as biomarkers for WLM (Prof. Himmerich).<br/>Treatment extends over four months for SFM and treatment as usual. Patients will be assigned to the treatment arm by randomization. The anthropometric and psychosocial indicators will be collected of each patient at pre-treatment T0, at post-treatment T1, six months after the end of treatment T2, twelve months after the end of treatment T3, and 24 months after the end of treatment T4. For an ancillary investigation of physiological parameters, blood samples will be taken from each patient at T0 and T1 (Prof. Himmerich). <br/>In total, 72 patients will be included in the study. The patients are required to be of full age, have a body mass index between 25.0 kg/m2 and 45.0 kg/m2, have undergone conservative weight loss treatment at the IFB AdiposityDiseases with ≥ 50% attendance, and show sufficient German language skills.

The patients of the second group receive additionally a controlled target planning and are checked for improvements regularly.;Background: Goal orientation of patients is considered as an important factor to support motivation for therapy in outpatient physiotherapy. However, evidence regarding the efficacy of this factor shows an uncertain data situation. Moreover, so far it is not obvious how it can be implemented in the daily physiotherapy practice. <br/>Goal: Aim of the controlled trial is to determine whether a common goal setting and agreement between patients and their responsible therapists inclusive regular monitoring, improves the motivation for therapy, and consequently, the treatment outcome. <br/>Method: In a clinical controlled trial two groups of patients with musculoskeletal disorders on the lower limb are compared. While the control group gets the usual standard treatment, the intervention group receives an additional goal-orientation.

For example high blood pressure, diabetes and it prevents lung, heart and Blood flow problems. For some illnesses sports is the best therapy method and can reduce the need of medicine or make it even obsolete. Old people are often not capable to do proper aerobic training because of orthopedical injuries. In high altitude the Workload for the patients will be reduced while having similar effects on the body.<br/>In this study we will give these Patients the possibility to do aerobic exercise training anyway. To achieve this goal we will provide training sessions in our therapy room. Our system to simulate high altitudes allows us to<br/>Lower the oxygen concentration to 14.2% (See level 21%). This means the room climate will be equivalent to 3000m over sea level. The air pressure won’t be affected. Consecutively our patients will train 7 exercise units of maximal 30 Minutes in our altitude laboratory (only patients from the Ghersburgklinik are allowed to participate). For this training patients can choose between bike and treadmill. We hope to prove that training on 3000m has better effects than training in normal height. The training will be monitored by a sports scientist. During the training we will measure oxigensaturation via pulsoximetry and heart rate via pulsbelt.  One Group will train at 3000m and one Group on 600m sham hypoxia, determined by chance. This will allow us to evaluate the differences.<br/>Before and after the exercise period Patients will perform a test on a bike (8-12min), to determine their physical fitness. We will check the heart parameters and function as well, via Echokardiography. In these tests our sports scientist will measure the breathing air and the ECG.<br/>Should we be able to see positive effects of this training it could be a big improvement for geriatric rehabilitation. Altitude training could be an important part in rehabilitation in the future Maybe our results will allow us to give instructions for easy hiking tours for old people even if they suffer from heart diseases.<br/>;<br/>Because of the development of our society geriatric rehabilitation gains more and more importance for public healthcare. The aim for rehabilitation is to keep old people as mobile and active as possible in order to prevent long stationary stays in hospitals and need of care. Unfortunately for geriatric rehabilitation there are often missing adequate methods or data to refer to. The study Effect of endurance training under hypoxic condition on Pulmonary and Cardiovascular Parameters in Elderly Inpatient Population will try to determine if training in an altitude of 3000m has effects for elderly Patients with cardiopulmonal diseases. In the rehabilitation of old Patients with several diseases there is often a missrelation between training capacity and suitable workload for training, a circumstance that produces bad rehab-output and disaffection in patients and therapists. Because of our experience with mountaineers and high altitude training and because of the positive effects of well dosed hypoxia on the cardiopulmonary system we are wondering if geriatric patients could benefit from altitude training. In hypoxia the demands of the cardiopulmonal system are higher than in normal heights. The heart rate is elevated and the hypoxia induced factor is causing adaptions on several points in the human body. These effects suggest that when the demands of the cardiopumonal system stay the same the workload (in watt) for our patients should be reduced while training in hypoxic air. Because of the reduced mobility and other restrictions old Patients have often problems to train with adequate heart rates for aerobic endurance training. Resuming these observations we want to investigate these effects with a group of 40 Patients of the Ghersburg geriatric clinic for rehabilitation. They will train for three weeks (standard duration for rehabilitation) each second day on a simulated height of 3000m in our hypoxia laboratory (normoxic hypoxia) on a treadmill. Each training unit will last from 10 to 30 minutes (normal duration for endurance training in geriatric rehabilitation). The results will be compared with a control group of 40 Patients who will perform the same training in normoxia. As pre- and posttest we will perform a Siroergometrical test as well as a cardiography. We hope to find significant differences between test and control group. Above all the maximal realizable power (Vo2peak) should be higher than in the group training in sham hypoxia. These findings would mean a much higher realizable activity of daily living for our patients and prove the benefits of the use of altitude training in geriatric rehabilitation. This kind of training could hold a lot of potential for therapy and above all for the Patients.<br/>;Recruiting complete, follow-up complete;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;http://www.drks.de//drks_web/navigate.do?navigationId=trial.HTML&TRIAL_ID=DRKS00005241;2015-07-27T17:26:35.808+02:00;;Ulm;FALSE;

Its distribution is involved in processes such as motivation, move-ment and concentration. To better understand the influence of these neurotransmitters on cognition and feeling, we modulate these neurotransmitters while healthy subjects (eg, short-term memory tasks) perform psychological tests. For technical reasons we can not affect the concentration of the neurotransmitter directly. We therefore do this indirectly before, by applying a so-called provocation tests, ie each of the substances given deflects the brain function like a pendulum in a certain direction. To this end, we give the volunteers before each of the three measurement dates as a pill.<br/>To understand the principle of our experimental setup, one can imagine the brain as a TV. We turn in our study by the provocation test the contrast knob to the left to look at how the ""image"" changes in response to this.

The Marnitz therapy was performed before PT and lasted 20 minutes. The control group received six times PT.<br/>All patients received the same six standardized treatment units PT. The duration was 30 minutes. The measures of PT directed on the current state of research and notably including exercises motility, strength and posture improvement. To reduce the risk of performance bias all six treatment sequences were determined in advance. The course of treatment has been documented, ie it was noted that all planned exercises were carried out or why not.;This was an exploratory, randomized pilot study. The aim of this pilot study was to evaluate the subjective and objective results of a physiotherapy treatment to evaluate (Marnitz therapy and treatment vs. only treatment) in patients with impingement syndrome through research and interviews, and compared with the starting position.<br/>The primary outcome measures were the functional improvement of the shoulder joint and a subjective pain relief for the patient.<br/>Secondary outcomes were other effects of the intervention but changing the level of suffering and change the position of the scapula as well as the study of the relationship between handedness and the affected side. In order to compare the progress and outcome of the treatments between the two groups at different time points corresponding test results were evaluated using the Constant score. The data were analyzed descriptively using Microsoft® Excel®. The effect measure was the mean difference. The statistical test was the t-test for comparison of two means metric populations in independent samples.<br/>Before and after the intervention no significant differences existed between the groups in terms of primary and secondary outcome measures . The comparative studies over a three week period showed both in the intervention group as in the control group therapy success. The intervention group improved statistically highly significant (p <0.01) in the criteria of mobility and the reduction of the positive Impingementtests and skapula position. The control group improved statistically highly significant in the criteria pain, activities of daily living, impingementtests and statistically significant (p <0.05) in reducing the level of suffering.

Recently we completed a cross-sectional study revealing that > 90% of the analysed pregnant women and newborns had a vitamin D level that was below the recommendation of the German Society of Nutrition. Due to these results we believe that pregnant women are at high risk of vitamin D deficiency . Hence, the aim of the current project is to investigate the effect of a daily intake of 25 µg vitamin D3 (1000 IU) on the vitamin D status during pregnancy. Only pregnant women with diagnosed vitamin D-deficiency that is defined as a blood concentration of 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25 OH D) less than 50 nanomol per litre (nmol/l), are receiving the vitamin D supplement. Women with 25 OH D level > 50 nmol/l are getting no supplement. Four blood samples are collected during pregnancy and one last is taken from the cord after birth.   ;An adequate supply of vitamin D is important for optimal health of both mother and child. Many studies show a link between an insufficient vitamin D status and complications during pregnancy, which can include gestational diabetes mellitus, pre-eclampsia and preterm birth. The risks for the newborn are related to an insufficient bone structure, lung disease, and also diabetes mellitus. Recently we completed a cross-sectional study revealing that 98% of the maternal and 94% of the cord blood samples had 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25 OH D) levels < 50 nmol/l, indicating a vitamin D deficiency defined according to the International Osteoporosis Society 2011 and the Endocrine Society 2011. Due to these results a vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy is highly recommendable. To date, not only the optimal vitamin D dose, but also the question on the adequate 25 OH D level have been the subject of great controversy. The aim of the present observational study is to investigate the effect of a daily vitamin D3 intake of 25 µg (1000 IU) during pregnancy until delivery on maternal and cord blood 25 OH D level. The supplement is prescribed to pregnant women with diagnosed vitamin D deficiency in the 12th and 16th week of gestation until delivery. Women with 25 OH D > 50 nmol/l are receiving no supplement. Four blood samples are going to be drawn at the routine ultrasound appointments in the first second and third trimester at the gynecologist. At delivery a sample from the umbilical cord is collected for analysis of the following parameters: 25 OH D (Enzyme immunoassay, ADVIA Centaur), 1,25(OH)2D3, parathyroid hormone, alkaline phosphatase and calcium. BMI, skin pigmentation, physical activity and exposure to sun light as well as anthropometric data of the newborn are assessed by a questionnaire or recorded from the medical file. ;Recruiting complete, follow-up complete;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;http://www.drks.de//drks_web/navigate.do?navigationId=trial.HTML&TRIAL_ID=DRKS00005421;2014-12-08T09:01:13.245+01:00;;Giessen;FALSE;

Besides of their constrained movement, affected persons often face difficulties in spatial perception. That means objects on the paralyzed side cannot be seen.<br/>This study uses the robotic technology PARO to improve the reduced perception. This technology comes in the shape of a young seal with white fur. PARO replies with sounds or moves the fins when spoken to or touched.<br/>The main object of this study is to examine if the spatial perception on the paralyzed side improves when the robotic technology PARO is used.<br/>Promotion: Hessisches Ministerium für Wissenschaft und Kunst and Fachhochochschule Frankfurt am Main (01.10.2012 - 30.09.2014);Neglect is an impaired spatial perception, which often occurs after a stroke in the right hemisphere. The most distinctive characteristic of the neglect is that the contralesional body or space is neglected. In most cases, the affected persons can no longer recognize visual, optical and tactile stimuli on their left side anymore. <br/>In the early phase, the therapies to improve the spatial perception of the patient are based on a multisensory stimulation. By presenting as many stimuli as possible, the neglected side of the body and of the spatial perception is stimulated to active exploration.<br/>Concepts to improve the perception are essential parts of therapeutic care during early neurological rehabilitation. Unfortunately, nursing interventions to reduce the deficits in spatial perception are currently neither in effect nor subject of systematic nursing examinations. Thus, this project is initiated.<br/>In this study, the robotic technology PARO is used as a therapeutic medium for multisensory stimulation. PARO is developed in Japan based on the model of a young seal specifically for therapeutically treatments. First results indicate that the use of this robotic technology evoke enhanced activity, increased interaction and wellbeing of the patient.<br/>The principal aim of this study is to develop a theory based intervention to improve the rehabilitation. The intervention will be tested in a pilot study in a special clinic for neurological early rehabilitation.<br/>;Recruiting complete, follow-up complete;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;http://www.drks.de//drks_web/navigate.do?navigationId=trial.HTML&TRIAL_ID=DRKS00005427;2016-07-25T19:41:50.481+02:00;;Frankfurt;FALSE;

One particular feature of ILAT is the use of utterances embedded in the context of communication and action. The current research project aimed to investigate whether or not this communicative-pragmatic action-embedded approach is crucial for the efficacy of the treatment. Patients with chronic speech and language disorders received two types of training: (i) standard ILAT focusing utterances embedded in settings of communication and action; and (ii) equally intensive Naming Therapy.

Tying up to the study of the research group Dr. Grossmann (Neurology 2010) we offer a mindfulness-based group training program to these patients. The training will be done for 6 weeks. <br/><br/>Patients are randomized in group A and B. All Patients (group A and B) will undergo a neurological examination and a neuropsychological testing.  Group A starts with the training. After the 6-week training all Patients (group A and B) will undergo again  the neurological examination and the neuropsychological testing. Then group B starts with the training (cross-over design).  After the 6-week training all Patients (group A and B) will undergo again the neurological examination and the neuropsychological testing.;Multiple Sclerosis is the neurological disease which leads most often to persisting impairments and early retirement in young adults. 60 to 90% of all MS patients suffer from fatigue, often in the early stages of the disease. For 15 to 50% of all MS patients, fatigue is of all symptoms the symptom disabling them the most in daily life, regardless of the degree of their physical impaiment. Paients suffer from uncontrollable fatigue, far worse from what they experienced before they were diagnosed with MS. As a consequence their participation in working life and social activities is extremely reduced. So far there is no medication  available. Treatment with Amantadin or Modafinil can be discussed  on an individual basis. A lot of treatment forms and  interventions  were tried, but not evaluated in scientific studies. There is a great need for studies which systematically investigate non-medication interventions. The research group of Dr. Grossmann (Neurology 75, 2010 pg 1141-1149) did a randomized-controlled study with 150 patients. Half of them received best medical treatment, half of them received a group training in addition to best medical treatment.

Intervention (in half of the participating practices): Within 5 weeks, physician assistents in each practice asked 120 patients between 20 and 50 years without a diabetes diagnosis to fill out the FINDRISC-test (control group). In the other half of the participating general practices 60 patients were recruited in each practice.

Patients, that were between 20 an 50 years of age an have not yet been diagnosed with diabetes were asked in their general practice to fill out the FINDRISC-form. The study design is a randomised controlled trial. In the 6 participating general practices, patients that had been diagnosed with obesety and/or had a positive family history were recruited for the intervention group. In the control-group (5 general practices), a representative group of patients were asked to fill out the FINDRISC-form.

Because of their impact on patient satisfaction as well as their economic and medical consequences, it is of great importance for all disciplines involved. Both prophylactic medication as well as the stimulation of the P6 acupuncture point can lead to a reduction of PONV. However, in high-risk patients a singular therapy often does not result in an adequate reduction of the incidence of PONV. Furthermore, no data are available on patient satisfaction under various forms of therapy. Because as part of the anesthesia -related risk reduction of morbidity and mortality endpoints well-being and patient satisfaction are becoming increasingly important to be examined, in this prospective randomized study possible additive effects of a multimodal concept of drug PONV prophylaxis and electrical stimulation will be investigated.<br/>Furthermore, in a side project we aim to investigate, whether genetic variants affect the response to stimulation of the P6 acupuncture point for the purpose of reducing PONV .<br/>To do this, we would like to form four study groups: stimulating the P6 acupuncture point/placebo, placebo / drug PONV prophylaxis, stimulation of the P6 acupuncture point / drug PONV prophylaxis, placebo/placebo. Only high-risk patients would be admitted to the study on the basis of their calculated PONV risk factors (> 60% ).;"Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) occurs in up to 30% of unselected patients and is the most common side effect of anesthesia. PONV represents a very negative experience for many patients, which is often considered worse than post-operative pain. Prevention of PONV thereby significantly improves the postoperative assessment of well-being and satisfaction. PONV can delay the postoperative removal of the patient from the recovery room and represents the most common reason for an unplanned stationary stay of a planned outpatient. Thus, PONV leads to high economic costs. Accordingly, the avoidance and/or reduction in the incidence of PONV represents an important principle of therapy.<br/>Through changes in the anesthesia management and use of anti-emetic agents such as dopamine antagonists, serotonin antagonists or dexamethasone, the incidence of PONV can be reduced, however not always completely avoided. Should PONV be treated prophylactically, the side effects of each individual medication must be considered and the effects carefully weighed. The prophylaxis becomes even more complicated when the drugs that are issued pre- or intra-operational, for a so-called ""rescue"" therapy, cannot be used. ""Rescue"" therapy is the therapeutic post operational use of anti emetic agents.<br/>The quality of postoperative patient care could be vastly improved by the introduction of a safe and effective measure(s) for the prevention of PONV.<br/>Interestingly, recent studies showed that stimulation of the P6 acupuncture point is associated with a reduced PONV incidence and a Cochrane database meta-analysis from  2009 came to the conclusion that stimulation of the P6 acupuncture point leads to a significant reduction of PONV (nausea: relative risk (RR) 0.71, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.61 - 0.83;) Vomiting (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.59 - 0.83;) Necessity of a 'rescue therapy' (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.57 - 0.83). Additionally, there was no evidence of a difference between P6 acustimulation and anti-emetic therapy on the incidence of nausea (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.13), vomiting (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.77-1.31) and the necessity of a 'rescue therapy' (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.59-1.13).<br/>The authors of this meta-analysis came to the conclusion that further studies would not discredit the conclusions that acupuncture reduces the risk for PONV. Instead, further studies are recommended to examine whether a combination of interventions (multimodal prophylaxis), with the combination of stimulation of the acupuncture band and anti-emetic therapy, act better as any one form of intervention alone, and whether these interventions interact with each other.<br/>We want to examine this theory in this study prospectively.<br/> <br/>To do this, we would like to form four study groups: stimulating the P6 acupuncture point/placebo, placebo / drug PONV prophylaxis, stimulation of the P6 acupuncture point / drug PONV prophylaxis, placebo/placebo. Only high-risk patients would be admitted to the study on the basis of their calculated PONV risk factors (> 60% ).<br/>As a secondary endpoint for this study we want to examine whether the effect of acustimulation is influenced by single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on the occurrence of PONV. To do this, the patient groups of P6 acupuncture point/placebo and placebo/placebo would be compared.";Recruiting complete, follow-up complete;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;http://www.drks.de//drks_web/navigate.do?navigationId=trial.HTML&TRIAL_ID=DRKS00005664;2016-11-28T15:52:35.047+01:00;;Duisburg;FALSE;

Former research found online counselling to be comparable with the classical face-to-face setting (see Barak, Hen, Boniel-Nissim, & Shapira, 2008; Cuijpers, Donker, van Straten, Li, & Andersson, 2010, for topical meta-analyses) and the quality of the therapeutic relationship was also found to be comparable (Andersson, et al., in press; Preschl, Maercker, & Wagner, 2011). Though, little is known about the differences between online and face-to-face-counselling as online comunication differs significantly from the classical setting. Online communcation may be caracterized by a signal reduction (Kächele, 2008), a stronger idealization of the conversational partner (Bargh, McKenna, & Fitzsimons, 2002) as well as by more self-disclosure (Suler, 2004). Our project wants to add to the literature by working out impact factors underlying online counselling in contrast to face-to-face counselling.";Recruiting complete, follow-up complete;Paper;[---]*;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563215301035;Gieselmann & Pietrowsky (2016);;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;http://www.drks.de//drks_web/navigate.do?navigationId=trial.HTML&TRIAL_ID=DRKS00005679;2015-09-10T16:46:37.840+02:00;;DÃ¼sseldorf;FALSE;

The patient does not feel pain even if the load pressure and thus the reduced blood flow to the foot over a long time. Thereby, the risk for the development of foot ulcers increases. For this study, we assume that the temperature in the foot  or the temperature drop under pressure , is a good holding and relevant marker for the lack of pain sensation and the Feeling of pressure . The aim should be to establish pressure and temperature curves , those limits are set using below which threatens the development of foot ulcers and submitted an optical / acoustic signal on.The present inventive insole is based on conventional , medically recommended insoles. In the surface of the insole a flat, uniformly strong depression ( profile) is incorporated into, a sensor system is inserted, in which several very thin pressure and temperature sensors are connected. The sole is designed so that the individually determined risk can be places at a temperature and pressure measurement .;The aim of the project is the development and testing of an insole for diabetes patients with severe nerve damage . It should provide information that is missing due to the polyneuropathy and are used for primary ( and secondary) prevention of foot ulcerations .<br/>Preliminary investigations have shown that, for a load pressure within about 10 minutes, the surface temperature of a foot is reduced locally by about 1K . The continuous drop in temperature is detected for 30 minutes . After short-term depressuring , the temperature rises under the foot again to the initial value. The investigations were carried out on unclothed foots or with stockings from cotton.<br/>The sole should be a constant companion of  risk patients after conditioning of the footwear and ultimately prevent diabetes damage of foot up to amputation or significantly delay and thus reduce the treatment costs (cost savings in health insurance ) .;Recruiting complete, follow-up complete;Trial results;7d6a552d-cc45-41a6-8f05-3f4f994497af;Abschlussbericht_final_120617_komneu.pdf;Abschlussbericht;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;http://www.drks.de//drks_web/navigate.do?navigationId=trial.HTML&TRIAL_ID=DRKS00005683;2017-10-24T16:08:36.256+02:00;;Magdeburg;FALSE;

It is a known fact that the conditions of the lungs lung specific characteristics differ significantly under controlled mechanical ventilation depending on either the prone or supine position respectively. However, there are few studies on the adjustment of ventilation parameters in lung- healthy patients in the prone position exist. The end expiratory pressure (PEEP) is of particular importance. PEEP can prevent periodic lung collapse and reopening in the small airways and alveoli (atelectasis) and thus can alter the gas exchanging surface of the lungs. In the present study, lung healthy adult patients will be ventilated at three different PEEP levels in the prone position. On any PEEP level, measurement of the respiratory mechanics, oxygen partial pressure in human blood and the distribution of lung ventilation (by means of electrical impedance tomography (EIT)) is carried out. The aim of the study is to identify the optimal PEEP level for ventilation in the prone position and to evaluate the relation of PEEP and individual patient parameters (eg. body weight, BMI). In the future, mechanical ventilation in the prone position with optimized PEEP levels can potentially reduce the risk of atelectasis and thereby reduce the risk of pulmonary complications after surgery.;The aim of the present study is to measure the airway pressure and flow, arterial oxygen partial pressure (PaO2) and the regional lung ventilation via electrical impedance tomography (EIT) at different end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) levels during volume controlled ventilation (VCV) in prone position. For this purpose 60 lung healthy patients undergoing general anesthesia and arterial blood pressure monitoring, are examined during an elective neurosurgical operation on the lumbar spine. In the prone position, a recruitment maneuver is performed for the expansion of the collapsed lung areas. Subsequently, the lungs will be ventilated at 6, 9 and 12 cmH2O PEEP level each for at least 20 minutes (randomized order). At the end of the breathing intervals airway pressure and flow, PaO2 and EIT will be recorded for about 5 minutes. We hypothesize that the increase in PEEP level during ventilation of healthy adult patients in the prone position, reduces the risk of atelectasis and improves the patients’ arterial oxygenation.;Recruiting complete, follow-up complete;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;http://www.drks.de//drks_web/navigate.do?navigationId=trial.HTML&TRIAL_ID=DRKS00005692;2015-11-25T08:37:00.949+01:00;;Freiburg;FALSE;

After induction of anesthesia and muscle relaxation, the elastic restoring forces of the lung tissue predominate and thus lead to collapsing of the lungs after a short time. For this reason, a positive endexpiratory pressure (PEEP) is applied during general anesthesia in order to keep the lower respiratory tract open. The transfer of patients from the anesthesia induction room into the operating room, however, requires the temporary disconnection from the ventilator. Hence the intrapulmonary pressure drops to atmospheric pressure level across the endotracheal tube (ETT). As a consequence there may be atelectasis and decreased oxygen content in the arterial blood. In the present study the incidence of atelectasis during ongoing positive airway pressure is to be examined in comparison to the decrease in airway pressure to atmospheric pressure occurring after disconnection from the ventilator. For this purpose, the ETT will be extended using a conventional breathing hose (7 cm) permitting maintenance of the positive airway pressure during the disconnection of the ventilator by occlusion of this hose. Before induction of general anesthesia, patients will be allocated in three study groups (randomization). For the period of patient transport from the anesthesia room into the operating room, the pressure levels in the patients’ lungs will either  be kept on atmospheric pressure  level (usual procedure), on end expiratory pressure level or on end inspiratory pressure level. Before disconnection, during patient transport and after reconnection to the ventilator, the airway pressure, as well as lung ventilation by means of electrical impedance tomography (EIT) as well as oxygen concentration in the arterial blood based on a total of two blood gas analyzes will be measured. The duration of general anesthesia is not affected by this study.;After induction of general anesthesia, the patient usually has to be transported from the anesthesia induction room to the operating room. This requires the disconnection from the ventilator and consequently leads to dropping of the airway pressure (Paw) to atmospheric pressure (atelectasis). Against this background, we hypothesize that continuous positive airway pressures during patient transport reduces the risk of atelectasis and keeps the arterial oxygen partial pressure constant. For this purpose, the endotracheal tube (ETT) is extended with a commercially available hose mount and the airway pressure sensor is placed between the ETT and the hose mount. By occlusion of the hose mount via a plastic clamp, the positive airway pressure can be maintained even during patient transport. A total of 45 lung healthy adult patients should be randomized and examined in three study groups each consisting of 15 patients. A control group with regular disconnection (Paw = 0 cm H2O ) is compared to a study group (1) with Paw at PEEP level ( max. 10 cm H2O) and to a study group (2) with Paw on inspiratory plateau pressure level (max 20 cm. H2O ). Randomization is achieved using a computer-generated randomization sequence. Before, during and after the disconnection from the ventilator Paw, regional lung ventilation evaluated by means of electrical impedance tomography (EIT) and arterial oxygen partial pressure in a blood gas sample are measured.;Recruiting complete, follow-up complete;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;http://www.drks.de//drks_web/navigate.do?navigationId=trial.HTML&TRIAL_ID=DRKS00005715;2015-11-25T08:37:50.136+01:00;;Freiburg;FALSE;

The present study attempts to test the contribution of different brain regions to motor learning in a specific type of experiment called ""visuomotor rotation"". <br/>The experiment consists of a training flanked by a pre and a post measurement. Learning of two kinds - implicit and explicit learning - is assessed via the change from pre to post measurement. <br/>Subjects are assigned to one of four groups that receive different types of brain stimulation. Thus, some subjects receive transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over the cerebellum, while others receive it over a part of the prefrontal cortex. An additional two groups receive placebo stimulation over the respective area. <br/>It is known that anodal tDCS of the type used for stimulation can increase the target region's ability to learn. <br/>Therefore, increased explicit or implicit learning in a stimulation group compared to its respective placebo group would indicate a close linkage between the target brain region and the type of learning.";"Motor learning consists of multiple processes (Haith & Krakauer 2013, Taylor & Ivry 2012, Wolpert, diedrichsen & Flanagan 2011). Importantly, knowledge acquired via different processes can be associated with different characteristics of the learned behavior (e.g. retention, stability against external distortion) (Zhu, Poolton & Masters 2012). Furthermore, some processes may be impaired in specific (medical) conditions (Abbruzzese, Trompetto & Marinelli, 2009; Hegele & Heuer 2013). For these reasons, an understanding of these processes and of their neuroanatomic correlates is of interest. <br/>Visuomotor rotation experiments are well-established as a paradigm for differentiating between explicit and implicit processes of motor learning (Hegele & Heuer 2010a, 2013; Heuer & Hegele 2011; Taylor & Ivry 2012). Imaging studies have indicated relevant regions for learning visuomotor rotations. According to these studies, one region that is frequently associated wiht implicit learning is the cerebellum (Diedrichsen, Hashambhoy, Rane & Shadmehr, 2005; Seidler & Noll 2008). The right lateral prefrontal cortex is often linked to explicit learning (Anguera, Reuter-Lorenz, Willingham & Seidler, 2011; Seidler, Noll & Chintalapati, 2006; Seidler & Noll 2008). Correspondingly, studies with patients with lesions in these regions show specific impairments of the respective learning types (Slachevsky, Pillon, Fourneret, Pradat-Diehl, Jeannerod & Dubois, 2001; Taylor, Klemfuss & Ivry 2010). Together, these studies indicate that the cerebellum is involved in implicit motor learning, the prefrontal cortex in explicit motor learning. However, the precise role of this involvemend still needs to be investigated.<br/>Interventions in healthy subjects, e.g. by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) or transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). Provide a means investigate the functional role of target brain regions in learning. While these methods have already been applied in visuomotor rotation studies (Hadipour-Niktarash, Lee, Desmond & Shadmehr 2007; Pascual-Leone, Wasserman, Grafman & Hallet 1996 for TMS, Galea, Vazquez, Pasricha, de Xivry & Celnik 2009 for tDCS), studies to date have not applied them to the cerebellum or prefrontal cortex and simultaneously differentiated explicit and implicit types of learning.<br/>Therefore, the present study investigates the influence of anodal tDCS over the right lateral prefrontal cortex and the cerebellum on explicit and implicit learning of a visuomotor rotation. Explicit and implicit learning are assessed sepearately via an estaplished paradigm (Hegele & Heuer 2010b, 2013; Heuer & Hegele 2011). Anodal tDCS is applied to modulate plasticity of the cerebellum and prefrontal cortex during learning, resprectively (Reis & Fritsch 2011, Reis, Schambra, Cohen, Buch, Fritsch, Zarahn, Celnik & Krakauer 2009). Based on the imaging and patient studies descriped, we expect an improvement in implicit learning compared to placebo when the cerebellum is stimulated and an improvement in explicit learning when the prefrontal cortex is stimulated.<br/><br/>References:<br/>Abbruzzese, G. et al.

This Ieads to serious visual impairment typically in one half of the visual space<br/>(called hemianopia) with significant impairments in every day life activities. The visual loss creates problems with reading, orientation in space and visually-guided mobility, especially driving which remain with the patients for the rest of their lives. New treatments options are therefore urgently needed to help these patients improve their sight. The prevalence of visual impairments in stroke is about 11.0 Mio. worldwide, with 2.1 Mio new cases annually.<br/>Recent studies have shown that there is justifiable hope that we might be able to improve<br/>visual functions . This is based on the presence of residual visual capacities of the brain which are not sufficiently activated. According to the ""residual vision activation theory"", residual visual tissue is located next to the lesioned area and in larger scale brain networks. By repetitively stimulating them it might be possible to improve vision. This is possible because of the brains ability to adapt to the damage, called ""neuroplasticity"".<br/>We wish to find the best possible Stimulation methods to activate residual vision by inducing<br/>brain plasticity. This will be accomplished by using modern non-invasive brain Stimulation technology which was already successfully used to improve vision after optic nerve trauma and motor performance deficits after strake. Four European research centres now combine their efforts to better understand the underlying neuronal mechanisms of brain plasticity and to find appropriate means to restore vision after stroke. lf successful, the project will uncover the potential to activate residual visual capacities after stroke and provide the basis for the commercial development of a novel, non-invasive current stimulation medical device. ln this manner many patients can be offered a solution to improve their vision in a Iasting way and thus improve their quality of life. lf the studies are successful, we expect that the new technology can be deployed to routine care of patients with visual impairment<br/>after stroke.<br/>The first Method is the so-called repetitive transorbital alternating current stimulation ( rtACS), ie a non-invasive alternating current stimulation, which has been successfully used for the reduction of visual field defects in individuals with damage to the optic nerve. The second Method is a combined application of rtACS with a direct current stimulation ( transcranial direct current stimulation , tDCS ) of the visual center. <br/><br/>The second Method is a combined application of rtACS with a direct current stimulation ( transcranial direct current stimulation , tDCS ) of the visual center. 3 The control pacing occurs at lower power levels. While it is believed that the first two of these electrical stimulation techniques have a positive influence on the performance in the area of the damaged visual field , it is not supposed for the control stimulation. Whether the patient is one of the two electrical stimulation method or the control treatment gets decided by a computerized random. The probability of obtaining one of the two electric stimulation method is , 67%. Regardless of the type of the method, the stimulation with repeated daily for 10 consecutive business days. <br/><br/>For the objective extraction of study data, it is necessary that neither the patient nor the diagnosticians know which method he receives. After completion of the examination of the patient is informed about the method he has received.<br/><br/> <br/><br/> <br/>";"Posterior artery stroke Ieads to serious visual impairments in 1/3 of all stroke patients (2.1 Mio cases annually). Therapies to restore vision are therefore urgently needed to improve quality of life and reduce health-related costs. We now propose to study visual system plasticity and evaluate the effects of a new non-invasive current brain stimulation method to achieve vision restoration.<br/>Residual vision and plasticity rearrangements of the visual system will be studied in patients and cats with posterior hemispheric infarcts. To this end we (i) first characterise visual dysfunctions and identify regions of residual vision, (ii) document signs of plasticity (e.g. receptive field reorganization, local activation and Iong-range connectivity changes), and (iii) attempt to modulate/enhance plasticity with non-invasive brain stimulation (alternative current (AC) applied transorbitally or direct current (DC) applied transcranially). Specifically, we will Iook for signs of local plasticity (receptive field and activation changes as documented by high resolution 7T fMRI and psychophysics experiments) and global plasticity, i.e. inter-hemispheric connectivity (resting state EEG/MEG and TMS-EEG connectivity tests) in patients and in cats before and after brain current Stimulation to check if plasticity was modulated in the right direction to achieve vision restoration.<br/>lf successful we will have a better understanding of vision plasticity after strake and have established non-invasive brain stimulation as a new tool to improve visual functions, thereby<br/>enhancing vision-related quality of life and participation in daily life. Our industry partner will implement the utilized technology to make it safely usable in routine clinical care. This is the first concerted effort to study the role of ""global"" and ""local"" mechanisms of visual systems plasticity in vision restoration in a series of clinical experiments using highly sophisticated technologies (which include connectivity studies using neurophysiological techniques such as resting state EEG/MEG, and high resolution 3T and 7T structural & functional MRI). lt is also the ""first-ever study"" in stroke using non-invasive brain stimulation as a means of driving brain plasticity towards vision restoration.<br/>";Recruiting complete, follow-up complete;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;http://www.drks.de//drks_web/navigate.do?navigationId=trial.HTML&TRIAL_ID=DRKS00005949;2018-11-05T12:55:03.249+01:00;;Magdeburg;FALSE;

(acronym: SAMS) is the testing and evaluation of a logistic uncomplex method to increase participation rate in colorectal cancer early detection. The project is conducted nationwide in Saarland, Germany. Both screening tests offered in the German statutory cancer screening program, testing for occult blood in the stool and screening colonoscopy, are included in the project. The project involves the implementation of key elements of an organized cancer screening program by repeated personal invitations and (in case of testing for blood in the stool) by sending of test materials.";With approximately 65,000 new cases and 26,000 deaths per year colon cancer is the most common cancer and second leading cause of cancer death in Germany. A large proportion of these cases could be prevented through early detection. The German statutory cancer screening program offers two tests to detect cancer: testing for occult blood in the stool and screening colonoscopy. However, these tests are only used to a limited extend. In a nationwide pilot project in Saarland key elements of an organized screening program for colorectal cancer should be tested in the Saarland population. The primary aims of the study are the detection and quantification of the increase in participation rate by a personal invitation procedure and, in case of stool tests, by sending of test materials. Target population are people born in 1962 and in 1957 (N 34,000) in Saarland, who are identified by the national residents' registration file, and randomised to an intervention and control group within each birth year. In 2012, intervention groups received an information and invitation letter for colorectal cancer screening on their 50th or 55th birthday by the Saarland Health Minister. The focus in the younger population is testing for occult blood in the stool. One part of the younger population receives an information and invitation letter together with a blood test kit. The focus in the older population is screening colonoscopy. After one year, the personal invitation procedure is repeated. By the evaluated invitation procedure and the desired use of cancer screening tests, no additional risks for participants exist. The survey of the use and the results of investigations are carried out by the physicians' association and a study center. The evaluation of fecal occult blood tests is performed at the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ). By means of control numbers (strings that are obtained from the identity data without recovery of the identity data), the billing data from the physicians' association can be linked with the data in the study center and analysed anonymously. The results of fecal occult blood tests are reported back from the DKFZ to the study center with a communication number that cannot be re-identified.;Recruiting complete, follow-up complete;Paper;[---]*;[---]*;Ärztekammer des Saarlandes (2012) Saarland als Testregion für den Nationalen Krebsplan.

However, guidelines also recommend not pretreating patients with clopidogrel when coronary anatomy is not known since some patients without indication for PCI would also receive clopidogrel and get therefore exposed to an unnecessary bleeding risk. Thus, these recommendations would prevent PCI immediately after diagnostic angiography, which is clinical routine in many hospitals.<br/>This trial aims to identify effective loading strategies that can be given immediately before PCI and that achieve a sufficient peri-interventional platelet inhibition.

Prior studies have shown that the acute effect of a knee sleeve was reduced knee adduction during gait. A subsequent longitudinal study confirmed this tendency but failed to reach statistical significance. In the present study, the inclusion criteria for subject have been narrowed in order to prevent those subjecs from participating who, even without a sleeve, have little or no functional impairment and therefore presumably cannat benefit from a sleev. <br/>Subject undergo a pre and post test where gait characteristics and joint proprioception are assessed with biomechanical tests with and without the sleeve. Between these two tests, there is an 8 week period during which subjects of the intervention grour are supposed to wear the sleeve at least 6 hours each day. Subjects of the control group must not wear a sleeve during this time.;"Osteoarthritis of the knee causes pain and impairs function of the respective joint. The consequence is an impairment of gait kinematics and neuromascular activation of the whole body and specifically the lower extremity (Block & Shakoor, 2010; Ornetti et al., 2010). A prior study at the Department of Sport Sciece of the University of Freiburg showed that wearing an elastic knee sleeve immediately influenced gait kinematics and kinetics (Schween et al., in prep.; Ethics vote No. 107/12). Based on these results, a subsequent longitudinal study tested if the observed effects would prevail during an 8-weeks intervention (184/13). Gait kinematics and kinetics were assessed in subjects with unilateral knee osteoarthritis in a pre and post measurement. The focus was on the frontal plane. The results showed tendencies in the same direction as the effects found by Schween et al. (in prep.). Specifically, the knee adduction moment was reduced by an average of 5%. However, these tendencies failed to reach statistical significance. A retrospective view of the two prior studies at our department indicates that the effects of a knee sleeve depend strongly on the individual impairment of knee function in general and knee function in the test situation in particular. More specifically: the longitudinal study inlcuded several subjects that showed no or little functional impaiment during baseline-testing without a knee sleeve already. We reason that the knee sleeve could not have further improved pain or function in these subjects in the test situation. Therefore, we keep the hypothesis that a knee sleeve can improve function, and particularly lateral differences in gait biomechanics, over a longer period. The aim of the current study therefore is to again test whether the effects found by Schween et al. (in prep.) prevail during an 8-weeks intervention. Based on experience from the earlier longitudinal study, we try to reduce the floor-effect described above by narrowing the inclusion criteria for the sleeve. Specifically, we want to prevent subjects from participating that show no or little functional impairment at baseline.

In each of the five participating Comprehensive Cancer Centers, an experienced palliative care physician will be hired for 18 months with a 50% position. During the preliminary phase of the study, the physician will be allowed time to establish the necessary structures for early palliative care within the clinic. In the main study phase, patients with metastatic cancer will routinely be offered a consultation with the palliative care physician within eight weeks of diagnosis. The main goal of the EVI project is to evaluate whether early palliative care can be implemented into the everyday clinical practice of Comprehensive Cancer Centers, and if so, what conditions are necessary for it to succeed. In addition, we are interested in (1) describing the type of support that patients would like from palliative care, (2) gaining information about the effect of palliative care on patients’ quality of life and healthcare costs, and (3) determining which factors could potentially ease or hinder the implementation of early palliative care, respectively. The long-term goal of this project is to create sustainable improvements in the care of patients with incurable, life-limiting cancer. ;The EVI project is a multi-center, prospective cohort study with a sequential control group design. The study is a project of the Palliative Care Center of Excellence (KOMPACT) in Baden-Württemberg, Germany, which was recently established to combine the expertise of five academic, specialist palliative care departments. The study is divided into two phases: preliminary phase (months 1-9) and main study phase (months 10-18). In each of all five participating academic Comprehensive Cancer Centers, an experienced palliative care physician will be hired for 18 months. During the preliminary phase, the physician will be allowed time to establish the necessary structures for early palliative care within the Comprehensive Cancer Center. In the main study phase, patients with metastatic cancer will be offered a consultation with the palliative care physician within eight weeks of diagnosis. After the initial consultation, follow-up consultations will be offered as needed. The study is built upon a converging, parallel mixed-method design. In the quantitative arm, patients will be surveyed in both the preliminary and main study phase at three points in time (baseline, 12 weeks, 24 weeks). Standardized questionnaires will be used to measure patients’ quality of life, symptom burden and mood.

However, If pain persists longer on, it restricts the quality of life considerably and becomes an independent disease. <br/><br/>The University of Freiburg has developed with its partners an online training for people with chronic pain. The online training GET.ON chronic pain was developed for people suffering from chronic pain with who wish to learn to improve their quality of life. <br/><br/>The aim of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the online training called GET.ON chronic pain - an online training for dealing with chronic pain. <br/>GET.ON chronic pain helps sufferers to give more space to own significant areas of life and life goals and to enhance the quality of life. The study will be carried out by the Universities of Freiburg, Marburg, Lüneburg, theUniversity Medical Center Freiburg. <br/><br/>GET.ON chronic pain based on Acceptance and Commitment Therapy. Scientifically proven strategies will be taught that help to identify ways to live a life to one´s own satisfaction. <br/>Participants learn for example: <br/>• strategies for dealing with pain <br/>• Strategies for dealing with unpleasant thoughts and feelings <br/>• How to give significant areas of life and life goals more space. <br/>The training is provided on a secure website and consists of seven lessons. Each lesson takes approximately 60-90 minutes. This can be carried out weekly on one´s own PC. In addition, motivational SMS can be sent on request. <br/><br/>Requirements for participation <br/>• Age 18 years or older <br/>• chronic pain for at least 6 months <br/>• Pain has considerably restricted in everyday life <br/><br/>Technical Requirements for participation: <br/>• Internet access and regular access to a computer. <br/>• E-mail address;Background: The Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is an effective intervention for the treatment of chronic pain. Internet-based pain interventions might be a (cost-)effective way to overcome treatment barriers of traditional face-to-face pain interventions such as lack of availability and accessibility. However, little is known about the general (cost-)effectiveness of Internet-based pain interventions and the specific (cost-)effectiveness of guided and unguided pain interventions. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a guided and unguided ACT-based online intervention for persons with chronic pain (ACTonPain as the name of the study).<br/><br/>Methods: In this pragmatic three-armed randomised controlled trial, the interventions called GET.ON chronic pain guided and unguided are compared with a waiting list control group. The two GET.ON chronic pain interventions differ only with respect to guidance, consisting of feedback emails from an e-coach after each module. GET.ON chronic pain consists of 7 modules that should be processed weekly. Content of the modules consist of information, interactive exercises, audio and video files. In addition, the participants can use an SMS coach that sends automatic motivational SMS regularly. Assessments take place before and after the intervention and 6 months after the randomisation of participants.<br/>Impact: The present study will contribute to improve the evidence base for internet-based pain interventions and provide valuable information about the treatment success and cost-effectiveness in relation to the intervention´s level of guidance (self-help only vs. guided self-help). If GET.ON chronic pain shows to be (cost-)effective, investigations in different healthcare settings should follow to examine possible ways of implementing ACTonPain into our health care systems. The implementation of GET.ON chronic pain could help to shorten waiting times, to expand access to pain treatment and possibly also to reduce treatment costs.;Recruiting complete, follow-up complete;Paper;fbfb4f59-6f24-4e82-96c2-8e34d5207079;1-s2.0-S2214782914000359-main.pdf;Studyprotocol;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;http://www.drks.de//drks_web/navigate.do?navigationId=trial.HTML&TRIAL_ID=DRKS00006183;2016-08-05T13:00:30.854+02:00;;Freiburg Ulm;FALSE;

Therefore, the acute pain management is of great importance especially at the recovery room.<br/>The acquisition of that subjective experience is difficult. Up to now, pain measurement is only possible by indicating pain intensity on a numeric rating scale. This conventional procedure will be performed in one study arm.<br/>With the help of A.N.I. monitors it should be possible to determine an objective pain scale via the calculation of indices of various parameters, such as heart rate variability and the breathing pattern, which have a high correlation with the value on the NRS and can be charged regardless of the cooperation of the patient. In the second study arm, this device will be used.<br/>The aim of this randomized controlled, single-blind study, is to investigate the suitability of the A.N.I. monitor to support the treatment of pain in the recovery room by means of comparing both study arms.<br/>;The aim of our study is the evaluation of the suitability of the ANI-Monitor for continuous monitoring of algesia on postoperative patients in the recovery room.<br/>The failure below the set limits of predetermined thresholds should help raise awareness of the staff in the recovery room. This should trigger questions by the staff about the patients pain sensations. The pain should be treated at an early stage, even before the patient expresses the pain spontaneously, as it often happens only at very intense pain (e.g. NRS>6). The total dose of aplicated analgesics and the average burden of pain (measured at middle NRS) can possibly be reduced for the patients.<br/>Due to the higher constancy of an appropriate drug level possibly also the total amount of administered analgesics, and thus of adverse events is reduced.<br/>Furthermore the common data of pulse oximetry will be charted, to be able to make a post hoc calculation of the SSI and to compare it with the ANI and the NRS. <br/>As secondary target parameter there will be a questionnaire to document the feeling oft the patient and to compare it in both groups.<br/>;Recruiting complete, follow-up complete;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;http://www.drks.de//drks_web/navigate.do?navigationId=trial.HTML&TRIAL_ID=DRKS00006220;2017-01-05T10:42:22.599+01:00;;Aachen;FALSE;

An electrode is places through the sacral foramen and the nerves that enable fecal continence are controlled by a pace maker.<br/>The known procedure is to first implant a test electrode. If an improvement of fecal incontinence can be achieved the permanent electrode will be implanted. There is a risk of treatment failure due to dislocation of the test electode. In case of negative testing the permanent electrode will not be implanted. Secondly, it can occour that improvement of fecal incontinence cannot be repeated after removal of the testing electrode. The aim of this study is to investigate the treatment of fecal incontinence by directly implanting a permanent electrode.;The development of SNS mus be regarded as a mulestone in the treatment of fecal incontinece. And while the indication is constantly expanding, not evera SNS-implantation is successful. SNS must be tested in in different steps to evaluate its effectiveness in the individual patient. The eamination of the nerve plexus can be regarded as periphere nerve evaluation (PNE). With PNE, the accessibility and the ability of stimulation can be examined in a uni - or bilateral way in S2-S3.<br/>During the test phase the patient keeps a stool diary in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the test electrode. There is no guaranty that positive results that were achieved using the test electrode can be repeated wth the permanent electrode. The implantation rate varies between 56 and 70%, in some trials 54%-84%. One part of the negative test results can be trace back to a dislocation of the test electrode that is a simple whire electrode. The permanent electrode possesses fine blades that prohibit dislocation.<br/>The problem of electrode dislocation is known in the urological context and led to the two-stage-procedure - the permanent Quad-Lead electrode is directly implanted, without haven a test phase. If successful, the pacemaker is going to be installed, if not, the electrode will be removed. With this two-step procedure, the implantation rate could be increased and the critical replacement of the whire test electrode is omitted. For the application of this method no data of RCT is available.;Recruiting stopped after recruiting started ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;http://www.drks.de//drks_web/navigate.do?navigationId=trial.HTML&TRIAL_ID=DRKS00006286;2017-04-20T09:50:55.446+02:00;;Freiburg;FALSE;

HE significantly affects neurocognitive functions leading to impaired quality of life, already if present in subclinical stages. <br/>Diagnosis of MHE is established by psychometric tests (e.g. number connection test, figure connection test, picture completion test). Objective and sensitive methods to assess MHE are visual evoked potentials and critical flicker frequency analysis (CFF). <br/><br/>A continuous therapy with rifaximin in combination with lactulose significantly reduces the risk of overt HE, recurrence and HE-related hospitalisations in randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trials (1-3).

In addition to the supine position, the lateral position is recommended, but it requires the use of tools in order to achieve a stable and secure storage. This is particularly true for infants who are 3 months and older and dominate the rotation in the prone position and back independently.<br/>The side rail storage offers the possibility to safely stabilize the infant from birth to the end of the seventh month of life in the lateral position and reliably to prevent it rotates in the risky prone position during sleep.<br/>By increasing the variability of storage and the risk of location-related head deformation is avoided, which is connected to the sole backing sheet.;The invariant supine position, in one infant the formation of a preferential attitude with rotation of the head to favor one side (position or rotational preference of the head). Such an attitude asymmetry often leads to a deformation of the head with a flattened occiput side, which is referred to as secondary or postural Plagiozephalus.<br/>The side-rail storage allows a positioning that counteracted the preferred head rotation and a position-related Plagiozephalus. The head rests under side storage fixation on the prominent occipital page on the pad. The weight of the head, the symmetrical shape of the head will be recovered over a period of time, which can be considered as a therapeutic intervention strategy in infantile attitude asymmetry.;Recruiting complete, follow-up complete;Trial results;a43d7bc6-2fb1-4b4a-8c36-156b15ca837b;Abschlussbericht Varilag.pdf;Abschlussbericht Varilag;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;http://www.drks.de//drks_web/navigate.do?navigationId=trial.HTML&TRIAL_ID=DRKS00006734;2017-10-25T10:31:24.686+02:00;;Magdeburg;FALSE;

For this purpose omega-3 fatty acid rich plant and fish oils with a high content of ALA or DHA (> 80% of the total fatty acids) will be supplemented. Moreover, the influence of the test products on the variation of the fatty acid composition in several blood compartments (total plasma, erythrocyte membranes, free fatty acids, phospholipids, triglycerides, cholesterolesters). Besides, immunologic parameters will be measured in plasma. Analysis will be carried out at five different time points (basal, after 1, 3, 6 and 12 weeks intervention) to monitor the course of target parameters over time. Oxylipin profiles as well as immunologic parameters will be carried out in untreated plasma as well as in plasma after ex vivo inflammatory stimulation.<br/>Additional explanations: For the DHA study 12 probands were recruited, for the ALA study 20 more probands will be recruited.

After the second stage, feedback will be shown such that subjects could compare their choices with the expert benchmark. With this design, we can disentangle the effect of merely announcing that feedback will be given (comparing subject behaviour in the first and second stages) and the effect of actually receiving feedback (comparing behaviour in the second and third stages), which allowed paediatricians to compare their average antibiotics provision for the 40 stylised cases with the expert benchmark.

To foster more rational antibiotics provision among physicians, antibiotic stewardship programmes have been initiated in several countries. Feedback on appropriate antibiotics usage is often suggested as a pivotal element in these programmes. Recently, social norm feedback in form of treatment recommendations by medical authority has been shown to have moderate effects on aggregate physicians’ prescription behaviour. Systematic empirical evidence on the effectiveness of social norm feedback on the individual physician is, however, still lacking. We therefore introduce a randomised, controlled framed field experiment to analyse the causal effect of feedback on individual paediatricians’ antibiotics provision. Also, it is unclear how antibiotics provision is affected by physicians’ individual characteristics. Using a comprehensive questionnaire – for example, on subjects’ demographics, personality traits, and risk attitudes – allows us to explore this link.<br/><br/>Methodology: Framed field experiment (behavioural decision experiment using a mobile computer lab)<br/><br/>The experiment:  Decision situation: Participants decide on the duration of antibiotics therapy for 40 stylised cases that are common in day-to-day paediatric practice at their tablet computers of the mobile computer lab.

Moodbuster (platform hosted by INESC Porto, Portugal) will be used in Germany, the Netherlands, France, Poland and England. Its platform is the interface that participants will use the Internet based CBT content – consisting of five modules – to get information on depression or work on therapeutic exercises (e.g. list of pleasant activities, ideas on problem solving). These exercises are only part of the treatment not of the data assessment for evaluation. Patients will also rate their mood, sleep and activities on a smartphone App to supervise their own treatment progress. All content that participants add to the platform or the App will only be read by their therapist. For every finished module participants receive one to two feedback e-mails from their therapist. <br/><br/>Therapists:<br/>Therapists plan and lead the face-to-face sessions according to the bCBT manual. They schedule meetings and online-feedback e-mails, control the treatment progress of the patients and write feedback. They support their patients also between the sessions in case of unexpected problems. Every message will be send via the contact option (SSL secured connection) on the Moodbuster website. Therapists have to document everything carefully, abide to data security and professional secrecy obligations and have to write a treatment report to the general practitioner if so wished by the patient. Therapists are psychologist in advanced training to become psychological psychotherapists under constantly supervision from experts. <br/><br/>Content:<br/>The core components of the bCBT treatment are (1) psycho-education, (2) cognitive restructuring, (3) behavioural activation, and (4) relapse prevention. Additionally there is content on problem solving and  physical activation. <br/><br/>Duration:<br/>There are ten online sessions (including 10 online-feedback e-mails) with one session per week and five face-to-face sessions every two weeks. There is also an additional technical introduction in a face-to-face meeting with the therapist. The bCBT will go for a period of ten to thirteen weeks. Each session is scheduled for 50 minutes. <br/>;Arm 2;Treatment as usual<br/>Treatment as usual (TAU) will be defined as the routine care that subjects receive when they are diagnosed with depression. In practice, this means that treatment as usual may vary between countries, setting, and among patients. We will not interfere with treatment as usual but we will monitor carefully what type of treatment subjects that are randomised to treatment as usual have received from the patient records and through self-report (including TIC-P measurements). Patients receiving TAU will also complete ecological momentary assessments (EMA) at the same time points as the patients randomised to blended care. However, this is not deemed part of their usual care treatment, this is considered assessment, although we acknowledge that the monitoring itself may have a small positive effect.<br/>;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Interventional;[---]*;Randomized controlled trial;Blinded;Active control (effective treament of control group);Treatment;Other;N/A;N/A;"The project E-Compared ends on June, the 30st in 2017.

The diagnosis of depression will be assessed via M.I.N.I. International Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I) version 5.0 on telephone. QUIDS and M.I.N.I. are considered as secondary outcomes. <br/><br/>Cost effectiveness: <br/>To calculate cost effectiveness according to Quality-adjusted-life-years (QALY’s) we use the EQ-5D-5L (EuroQol) and in addition Trimbos andiMTA Questionnaires on Costs Associated with Psychiatric Illness (TiC-P; Hakkaart-van Rooijen, van Straten, Donker, Tiemens, 2002) as well as the Assessment of Quality of Life instrument (AQoL) (Hawthorne, Richardson, & Osborne, 1999). <br/><br/>QUIDS-16-SR, EQ-5D-5L, TiC-P & AQoL will be assessed to all 4 measurement points.

In 2010, 30 million Europeans were affected by depression and their number is still growing. Half of Europeans in need of mental care for depression do not have access to care services, do not always receive evidence-based treatments, are confronted with long waiting lists or high care expenditures. Internet-based treatment has the potential to addresses the drawbacks of standard care and keep depression treatment of high quality and affordable in Germany and the rest of Europe. <br/><br/>Objective: <br/>We evaluate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of blended internet-based depression treatment as compared to treatment-as-usual (TAU) in routine primary healthcare and specialised mental health service centres. We want to determine what treatment works best, for whom, and under what circumstances.<br/><br/>State of Research: <br/>There is ample support for the effectiveness of Internet-based CBT for depression which is considered a promising alternative to routine depression treatment strategies. Most evidence comes from randomized controlled trials, however, and not from research in routine practice. The E-COMPARED project aims to gain knowledge on the clinical and cost-effectiveness of blended CBT depression treatment as compared to treatment as usual in routine care.<br/><br/>The project: <br/>E-Compared (European Comparative Effectiveness Researchon Internet-based Depression Treatment) is a 3,5-year Europe-wide health research project funded by the European Commission. It is the first project to evaluate this kind of intervention across European countries to optimize mental health care systems.<br/>Visit www.e-compared.eu for more information.<br/><br/>Intervention: <br/>Participants will be randomized to two groups: <br/>A. treatment-as-usaul by their general practitioner with later participation in the internet-based intervention after the end of the study<br/>B. direct participation in the blended internet-based intervention<br/>Blended treatment entails a combination of internet and mobile-based, and face-to-face interventions. <br/><br/>Participants: <br/>Participants will be recruited from routine mental healthcare settings. <br/>Inclusion criteria include age above 18, a diagnosed major depressive disorder, availability of fast internet on PC and smartphone and the motivation to be treated for 10-13 weeks. Participation is not possible if there is a current psychotherapeutic treatment or if there are so many comorbidities or suicide intention that a more intensive treatment is appropriate.<br/><br/>Benefit: <br/>For patients: <br/>Participation is free of charge. Our intervention can help to reduce depressive symptoms and to gain more quality in life. Our participants receive a qualified clinical diagnostic interview. The internet- and mobile-components of Moodbuster can be used at any time or place. There will be up to 90€ compensation for expanses such as time for assessments. <br/><br/>We invite general practitioners to cooperate with us in recruiting patients for our study.

Half of Europeans in need of mental care for depression do not have access to care services, do not always receive evidence-based treatments, are confronted with long waiting lists or high care expenditures. Internet-based treatment has the potential to addresses the drawbacks of standard care and keep depression treatment of high quality and affordable. <br/><br/>Objective:<br/>E-COMPARED aims to provide mental healthcare stakeholders with evidence-based information and recommendations about the clinical and cost-effectiveness of blended depression treatment. The goal is to evaluate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of blended Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) for adults with major depressive disorder (MDD) as compared to TAU in routine primary healthcare and specialised mental health service centres. Therefore we perform a two armed, randomised controlled non-inferiority and cost-effectiveness trial in different European countries. The trials will be conducted in routine primary or specialised mental health care. Respondents in both conditions will be followed up to 12 months after baseline (measures will be taken at BL, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months).<br/><br/>Participants:<br/>Patients will be recruited from routine clinical practice and will receive either depression treatment as usual or blended CBT depression treatment. Specific recruitment procedures depend on the country and the setting. In all settings consecutive patients that visit the GP (primary care) or the mental health specialist (secondary care) with major depressive disorder will be invited to take part in the study. ;Recruiting complete, follow-up complete;Paper;723b3447-e6cf-4819-9fce-8f43657d4645;Titzler et al.

If they suffer from only mild respiratory distress the baby breathing might be assisted by a small nasal mask providing a constant air flow, this mode being called CPAP. It has shown that this kind of so called non invasive respiratory support may help those preterm infants to stabilize their breathing and contributes to avoid more invasive means of respiratory support. We are researching whether CPAP might actually be more effective when an oscillating air flow is being used. Our aim is to determine if these oscillations might improve respiratory stability in term of levels of carbon dioxide in these infants. ;Nasal high frequency oscillatory ventilation (nHFOV) is a new mode of noninvasive neonatal respiratory support. An oscillatory pressure waveform is applied over a constant gas flow to the airways using a nasal or nasopharyngeal interface thus combining effects of nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) and high frequency oscillatory ventilation. nHFOV is described both in bench studies and case series to be superior to nCPAP in terms of CO2 elimination and is utilized in an number of neonatal unit throughout Europe. However, there are no randomised controlled trials comparing nHFOV to any other mode of respiratory support. In this trial we are treating premature infants < 32 weeks of gestational age with 4 hours of nCPAP and 4 hours of nHFOV in an crossover design. Infants will be randomly assigned to the sequence of mode of respiratory support. Infants received surfactant or were extubated less than 24 hours prior to randomization. We 	hypothesise nHFOV to be significantly more effective in terms of CO2 elimination compared to nCPAP.;Recruiting complete, follow-up complete;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;http://www.drks.de//drks_web/navigate.do?navigationId=trial.HTML&TRIAL_ID=DRKS00007171;2016-11-23T10:29:36.833+01:00;;Freiburg;FALSE;

The foam roll is put under one thigh and the patient tries to roll down the whole thigh and the lower leg as far as possible. The patient supports his position using both hands.<br/>3.	Self-myofascial manipulation of the thoracolumbar fascia with a foam roll (“blackroll-orange STANDARD™”). The patient sits on the foam roll and slides down the roll until the roll reaches the shoulders. During the exercise, the patient strains the abdominal muscles. Arms either are crossed before the chest or support the head. The exercise is exerted for 30 seconds, too.<br/>4.	Patients will be instructed for a “fascial stretch”: a three-dimensional stretch of dorsal fasciae. The patient stands in front of chair, shoulder wide stance, hands on the seat going down into squat. The spine is stretched from buttock to top. In a next step the starting position is twisted to one side by moving the right side of the pelvis upwards and extending the right knee. Fingers and toes are extended, too, the patient looks at his right hand. The patient tries to stretch himself a little more until feeling a deep stretch on the right back side of the body.

A genetic mutation, specifically, the PNPLA3 148M substitution, lowers the potential to break down these unsaturated fatty acids. This could lead to a build-up of these fatty acids in the liver. Interestingly, the consumption of unsaturated fatty acids (e.g. Mediterranean diet) is recommended for dyslipidemia and fatty liver. Based on this we predict that not all individuals will have the same response to a diet high in unsaturated fatty acids, and that it will depend on the genetic make-up. We therefore want to carry out an intervention study, whereby individuals with various genetic mutations receive unsaturated fatty acids, and are followed up for several weeks, to see what, if any effect the dietary change has on liver fat contents.;Romeo and colleagues were the first to discover a clear risk for NAFLD with a genetic variation of the patatin-like phospholipase family (PNPLA3) .  PNPLA3 is a protein expressed in the liver with an intracellular lipase activity that is more pronounced against unsaturated fatty acids. The PNPLA3 148M substitution cause a loss of function of enzymatic activity with regards unsaturated fatty acids. Interestingly, the consumption of unsaturated fatty acids (e.g. Mediterranean diet) is recommended for dyslipidemia and hepatic steatosis. Based on this we predict that PNPLA3 wild type individuals will have the most benefits from the dietary change with polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), as compared to homozygotes for the PNPLA3 148M mutation, in who long term dietary PUFA intake may actually be detrimental. The goal of this pilot study is to carry you a dietary lipid modification study in  both PNPLA3 wild type individuals as well as in those that are homozygous for the PNPLA3 148M mutation.<br/> <br/><br/>;Recruiting complete, follow-up complete;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;http://www.drks.de//drks_web/navigate.do?navigationId=trial.HTML&TRIAL_ID=DRKS00007781;2019-05-20T10:36:37.945+02:00;;Homburg;FALSE;

Adolescents engaging in self-injurious behavior show decreased pain sensitivity compared to healthy controls. For example, adolescents with non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) shot greater pain thresholds and pain tolerance. However, previously no study addressed if these differences in self-reports are also reflected by differences in the physiological response to experimentally induced pain. Two common stress systems - the Hypothalamic–Pituitary–Adrenal (HPA) axis and the autonomic nervous system (ANS) - are reactive to experimentally induced pain in humans. The present study explores differences in the neurobiological stress response to experimentally induced pain comparing adolescents with NSSI to healthy controls. All participants are asked to emerge their hand in ice water until the pain becomes intolerable. Blood pressure and saliva cortisol are collected before and after nociceptive stimulation. Heart rate and heart rate variability are recorded continuously throughout the procedure. Furthermore, participants are asked to complete self-report on pain intensity after painful stimulation. Difference between groups are assessed statistically. It is hypothesized, that lower self-reports of pain sensitive are further reflected by decreased reactivity of the HPA axis and ANS in adolescents with NSSI.<br/><br/>;Adolescent Non-Suicidal Self-Injury (NSSI) is associated with altered pain sensitivity. However, previously no study addressed if this altered sensitivity is also associated with blunted physiological reposes to experimentally induced pain. The present study investigates the reactivity of the autonomic nervous system (ANS, heart rate, heart rate variability, blood pressure) and the Hypothalamic–Pituitary–Adrenal (HPA, saliva cortisol) axis to experimentally induced pain in adolescents with NSSI. The cold pressor task is used as standardized method of nociceptive stimulation and to assess pain threshold and pain tolerance in all participants. Saliva is collected before and after painful stimulation and heart rate and heart rate variability are continuously recorded throughout the procedure. Furthermore, the blood pressure is measures before and after painful stimulation. It is hypothesized, that decreased pain sensitivity in adolescents with NSSI is also associated with blunted reactivity of the ANS and HPA to experimentally induced pain.<br/>;Recruiting complete, follow-up complete;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;http://www.drks.de//drks_web/navigate.do?navigationId=trial.HTML&TRIAL_ID=DRKS00007807;2017-03-29T08:48:16.904+02:00;;Heidelberg;FALSE;

This intervention study investigates whether probiotic supplementation improves depressive symptoms in patients with the chronic hepatitis C virus. <br/><br/>Our hypothesis: probiotic supplementation improves depressive symptoms in patients with the chronic hepatitis C virus infection.;Patients with chronic liver disease are at increased risk for depressive and cognitive disorders, which have a strong influence on the quality of life. Pharmacological treatments for depression are not always effective, and some patients are not willing to take psychiatric drugs because they fear the side effects. Experimental studies have shown specific strains of intestinal bacteria to positively influence brain neurotransmitters which are implicated in depression. Moreover, clinical studies have shown that psychological distress and depressive symptoms can be alleviated by probiotic supplementation. Dysbiosis has been confirmed in patients with chronic liver disease and the hepatitis C virus infection. Treatment with antidepressants needs to be avoided in certain patients, because of the risk of adverse liver-related effects. We therefore want to perform a controlled study to investigate the role of probiotic supplementation for 60 days in depressive symptoms in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus infection.;Recruiting stopped after recruiting started ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;http://www.drks.de//drks_web/navigate.do?navigationId=trial.HTML&TRIAL_ID=DRKS00007817;2019-05-20T11:00:43.999+02:00;;Homburg;FALSE;

One critical feature of ILAT is the high intensity of the training. The current randomized controlled trial seeks to investigate whether or not high training intensity contributes to the efficacy of the program in stroke patients with speech and language disorders. To address this question, patients are randomly assigned to (i) standard ILAT with high training intensity or (ii) a modified, less intensive form of ILAT. We predict a particular benefit on standardized clinical tests resulting from (ii) standard ILAT compared to (ii) modified ILAT. The expected results will hopefully provide insight into whether high training intensity is crucial for the efficacy of ILAT.;The current randomized controlled trial aims to investigate the role of training intensity in Intensive Language-Action Therapy (ILAT) in left-hemisphere stroke patients with chronic aphasia. Patients are randomly assigned to (i) standard ILAT with high training intensity or (ii) a modified, less intensive form of ILAT.<br/><br/>Note: This study is part of a larger clinical trial, consisting of two separate projects.

This complication is called pancreatic fistula. To date, numerous surgical efforts to solve this problem have been ineffective. Naturally, the pancreatic fluid flows through the pancreatic duct towards the small intestine. Studies with the aim to promote this way by insertion of a tube into the pancreatic duct have shown promising results. However, because of prosthesis-associated disadvantages and risks a tube-free approach would be more favorable. To control the outflow of pancreatic juice into the small intestine, there is a special muscle, the so called sphincter of Oddi. By reducing sphincter pressure, injection of a muscle relaxant drug, botulinum toxin, into the sphincter of Oddi represents a safe and effective treatment option in patients with so called sphincter of Oddi dysfunction. With the aim to improve the outflow of pancreatic fluid into the small intestine and thereby lower back pressure on the resection margin of the pancreas, drug-induced sphincter relaxation may prevent pancreatic fistula successfully. The objective of this clinical trial is to evaluate the technical feasibility, safety and efficacy of a preventive injection of botulinum toxin into the sphincter of Oddi within seven days before surgery in 24 patients scheduled for resection of the tail of the pancreas.;Postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF) is the most important complication after distal pancreatectomy. Numerous recent surgical efforts to reduce POPF rate by special closure techniques of the pancreatic stump have been ineffective. In contrast, studies investigating endoscopic stenting with the aim to improve drainage of pancreatic fluid into the duodenum have shown promising results. However, because of prosthesis-associated disadvantages and risks a stent-free approach would be more favorable. By reducing sphincter pressure, endoscopic injection of botulinum toxin into the sphincter of Oddi represents a safe and effective treatment option in patients with sphincter of Oddi dysfunction. In the setting of distal pancreatectomy, pharmacologically induced sphincter relaxation to improve drainage and thereby lower back pressure on the resection margin of the pancreas may prevent POPF successfully. The objective of this prospective clinical trial is to evaluate the technical feasibility, safety and efficacy of a prophylactic endoscopic injection of botulinum toxin into the sphincter of Oddi within seven days before surgery in 24 patients scheduled for elective distal pancreatectomy.;Recruiting complete, follow-up complete;Paper;[---]*;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0039606016305050;Ergebnispublikation;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;http://www.drks.de//drks_web/navigate.do?navigationId=trial.HTML&TRIAL_ID=DRKS00007885;2018-10-17T15:59:38.886+02:00;;Heidelberg;FALSE;

Problems might be caused or aggravated, as affected persons do not adapt communication optimally to the situation and interlocutors. The aim of this study is the development and evaluation of a training aiming to improve the communication of persons with rheumatic diseases in doctor consultations and other communication situations. The overall project consists of two studies. Study 1 identifies factors which increase or decrease the social participation of persons with rheumatic diseases. This study is conducted at the Institute for Rehabilitation Medicine (IRM), Martin-Luther-University Halle-Wittenberg. Based on the results of Study 1, we will extend and adapt an existing patient communication training. After testing the training (called “KOKOS-Rheuma”), we will conduct the training in 20 self-help groups for persons with rheumatic diseases. We evaluate whether the training improves the communication skills and the activity of the participants and whether it influences their assessment of social participation and limitation caused by illness. Moreover, we investigate whether the participants evaluate the training positively, experience it as useful and that they can apply the skills in everyday life. Persons with rheumatic diseases are actively involved in the development and evaluation of the training throughout the project. ;"Persons with rheumatic diseases frequently have a decreased social participation due to various health problems and related limited resources. Insufficient communication skills can be one factor which limits social participation. Insufficient communication skills comprise amongst others one-way patient-doctor communication and deficient or even missing information of important others about the disease and its symptoms. Moreover, insufficient communication can be detrimental to getting a job or pursuing one’s own profession. <br/>The project consists of two studies. Study 1 (“inForm”) aims to identify factors which increase or decrease the social participation of persons with rheumatic diseases. The focus is on factors and aspects of participation which can be influenced by communication. This study is conducted at the Institute for Rehabilitation Medicine (IRM), Martin-Luther-University Halle-Wittenberg.<br/>The aim of Study 2 is the development and evaluation of a training on communication skills in doctor consultations and other communication situations. The doctor-patient relationship is a dyad and both parties are responsible for the success of their exchange. While there is a lot of research on doctors’ communication skills and many communication skills trainings for doctors exist, there are much fewer interventions to improve patients’ communication skills. <br/>Based on the results of Study 1, we will adapt an existing patient training on communication skills in doctor consultations to the specific needs of persons with rheumatic diseases. Furthermore, we will extent the training to other communication situations. After testing the training (called “KOKOS-Rheuma”), we will conduct the training in 20 self-help groups for persons with rheumatic diseases (overall about N=300 participants). We randomly assign the groups to the intervention and wait-list control group. The training will be evaluated using a cluster randomised design with wait-list control group.<br/>The primary, proximal outcomes are participants’ communication competence and patient activation; the secondary, distal outcomes are social participation and disease-related limitations of activities. We assess the outcomes by using questionnaires. Moreover, we investigate whether the participants evaluate the training positively, experience it as useful and that they can apply the skills in everyday life. In addition, we will adapt an existing questionnaire (CoCo-questionnaire; questionnaire to assess communication competence of chronically ill patients in doctor consulations) to the communication situations relevant in the project and test its psychometric properties. <br/>The project is a participatory research project. We consider the current discussion as well as requests regarding patient participation in research, and we actively and equally involve persons with rheumatic diseases throughout the project.

This fasting month consisted of 29 or 30 days. During this month no food, drink, smoking, sex, medications, inhalation or intravenous nutritional fluids are permitted from dawn to sunset, but these are allowed at night. For the exact timing, the beginning and end of the fast each day vary according to the date and geographical location. In Germany, particularly, in Hannover the 1st Ramadan 2015 may start at about 2:45 and end at about 21:45 and will change every day according to the dawn and sunset time. <br/>For muslims, fasting is not perceived as a corporal punishment, but a blessing with many rewards, particularly spiritual. It has been known that this is also practiced not only in Islamic culture, but also in other religions and cultures around the world since many years.  The possible benefits of fasting to health have been noted, including mood enhancement and increased vigilance. <br/>In this study we would like to know how the effect of Ramadhan fasting and its correlation with measure one of molecules that related to mood, it is called brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF).<br/>This study will have two groups. One group will do fasting in Ramadhan (fasting group), the other group (control) will not do fasting. Healthy volunteers will be recruited (mostly students from Hannover Medical school) for both group. To be eligible to the fasting group, participants have to: (1) healthy (especially free of pain and psychiatric disorders), (2) be a male gender, (3) older than 18 years of age, (4) be planning to fast the whole month of Ramadan (5) The subjects will not do Ramadhan fasting for the first experience in their life (6) understand German/English language. For control group, all subjects should meet the criteria of fasting group, except that they will not do fasting.<br/>In fasting group, there will be 4 time points: one week before Ramadhan, in the mid of Ramadhan, in the end of Ramadhan, and one week after Ramadhan. Meanwhile, in control group there will be only 2 time points: one week before Ramadhan and in the end of Ramadhan.<br/>From these two groups, we will take blood and analyze the level of BDNF from serum. Additionally, they will be asked to fill in questionnaires related to health-related quality of life.<br/>;Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is one of neurotrophins that plays a role in different type of function related to neuronal systems. Many types of neurological diseases related (at least some part) to this factor (e.g. major depressive disorders, Parkinson’s disease, chronic pain, etc). <br/>Some reports have shown the effect of calories intake on BDNF. Studies focused on different groups of patients (metabolic syndrome, schizophrenia).<br/>Although some reports have shown the role/mechanism/correlation of BDNF and fasting, however there is no report regarding fasting in Ramadan and its correlation with the level of BDNF, especially in Germany which has longer period of fasting during summer time. Therefore we will recruit healthy subject and do a prospective study to observe the association of Ramadhan fasting and BDNF. This study will have two groups. One group will do fasting in Ramadhan (fasting group), the other group (control) will not do fasting. Healthy volunteers will be recruited (mostly students from Hannover Medical school) for both group. To be eligible to the fasting group, participants have to: (1) healthy (especially free of pain and psychiatric disorders), (2) be a male gender, (3) older than 18 years of age, (4) be planning to fast the whole month of Ramadan (5) The subjects will not do Ramadhan fasting for the first experience in their life (6) understand German/English language.

Meanwhile, in control group there will be only 2 time points: one week before Ramadhan and in the end of Ramadhan.<br/>As improvement and vitality have been reported, it is hypothesized that BDNF will be changed during fasting period. Secondly, it will be proven if this will be relevant to the mood and pain thresholds.  <br/>From these two groups, we will take blood and analyze the level of BDNF from serum.

We will analyse various measured data of the respiratory tract throughout ventilation. Distribution of air within the lungs will be assessed by electrical impedance tomography (EIT). Collapse of air sacs in small lung-areas (atelectasis) often occurs during artificial ventilation under general anaesthetic. Several methods can be used to prevent this. Our trial will compare two of those methods, to consequently optimize artificial ventilation.;"Scientific analysis of respiratory mechanics during artificial ventilation in lung-healthy adults has been rather understudied so far. We believe, supported by recent trials, that an elevated positive endexspiratory pressure (PEEP) could potentially prevent ventilator associated lung injury [1,2]. Controlled expiration (FLEX) might be an alternative way to achieve similar effects, without requiring higher PEEP levels [3,4]. This trial assess, how changes throughout the expiration will affect respiratory mechanics (i.e. ventilation and compliance). Therefore, effects of elevated PEEP will be compared with those of controlled expiration (FLEX). Analysis will be conducted using gliding-SLICE-analysis [5,6]. Furthermore, the ventilation and gas distribution within the lungs will be evaluated by electrical impedance tomography (EIT).<br/>Literatur: <br/>[1] Futier et al.

In order to make an informed choice, people with multiple sclerosis need comprehensive and independent information about risks and benefits of available options. Here, information on statistical study results is challenging.<br/>Therefore, we want to find out whether different variants of patient information on confidence intervals are understandable and helpful for people with multiple sclerosis. Confidence intervals are statistical parameters, which are helpful to estimate the reliability of therapy benefits. <br/>The patient information will be tested via a web-based randomised controlled trial. Study participants will be randomly assigned to one of four study groups (video or written information). Afterwards, they will complete a short questionnaire to estimate comprehension and knowledge of confidence intervals. <br/><br/>;Background <br/>Because people with multiple sclerosis are confronted with different immunotherapy options, the concept of shared decision making is of high relevance in order to make a treatment choice. Besides information about treatment effects, such as absolute risk reductions, confidence intervals are helpful to estimate the reliability of these estimates from clinical studies. <br/>Methods/Design <br/>In a web-based randomised controlled trial 572 eligible people with multiple sclerosis will be randomly assigned to one of three versions of audio-visual patient information (intervention groups) or a corresponding standard information (control group). The interventions have been pre-tested with regard to feasibility and comprehensibility. Primary endpoint is increase in comprehension, measured by a short multiple choice questionnaire. The questionnaire was validated (n=64) and the sample size calculation was based on the results. <br/>Discussion <br/>This randomised controlled trial will assess the effectiveness of different audio-visual patient information to explain confidence intervals. Understanding confidence intervals may help people with multiple sclerosis to compare different treatment options and making informed decisions in line with their preferences and values. <br/>Keywords: Multiple sclerosis, confidence intervals, shared decision making, randomised controlled trial, patient information, evidence-based medicine<br/>;Recruiting complete, follow-up complete;Further trial documents;c40fc75c-e654-4fdc-b54d-6056bd1e7e2f;COCO_MS_StudyProtocol.pdf;Studienprotokoll/study protocol COCO-MS;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;http://www.drks.de//drks_web/navigate.do?navigationId=trial.HTML&TRIAL_ID=DRKS00008561;2019-10-29T14:45:39.107+01:00;;Hamburg;FALSE;

Training modalities e.g., virtual reality (VR) simulators, inanimate box or pelvi trainers, and cadaveric organ trainers can be used as a safe, ethical, and effective means to do this.<br/><br/>Pelvi trainers are considered one of the best modalities to learn basic laparoscopy skills because they mimic the physical operating environment with real instruments. Since pelvi trainers uses an indirect view via an external monitor, the laparoscopic view, they provide a realistic platform for the learning of intracorporeal suturing and knot tying. This is an invaluable skill needed for minimally invasive operations. In fact, suturing skills learned during training via a pelvi trainer suture model have been shown to transfer to the operating room. Training within the pelvi trainer often involves using games, real cadaveric organs, or a standard suture pad, which familiarize trainees with the two major facets of laparoscopy: psychomotor control and visuospatial orientation. <br/><br/>MIS involves learning a separate skill set from that of open surgery. Although some of the necessary qualities are the same e.g., bimanual dexterity and steadiness, many of the basic skills must be learned for the first time or anew e.g., the fulcrum effect, 2D-3D coordination, pivot effect, limited degrees of freedom for tissue grasping, needle manipulation, suturing and knot tying, etc. These basic skills give surgeons the tools necessary to complete full operations; therefore the learning of these skills has become one of the cornerstones of laparoscopic training curricula. Psychomotor learning and visuospatial orientation are the two major aspects of laparoscopy that should be learned prior to going into the operating theater. Laparoscopy utilizes an indirect view, necessitating surgeons to be familiar with depth perception and 2D-3D spatial understanding. However, it remains to be determined if the learning of psychomotor and visuospatial skills concurrently is optimal, as in a pelvi trainer with laparoscopic view. Learning these two skills separately and sequentially may offer a more effective training alternative that reduces the overall training time of novices. This would lower the workload of tutors and learning curve of trainees, and save valuable time in a training center. Therefore, we explore here whether sequential learning with a transparent shoebox, where one learns the psychomotor movements, followed by training with a pelvi trainer with laparoscopic view, expedites the learning of the surgical C-loop technique in comparison to training solely with a pelvi trainer, where one learns the psychomotor and visuospatial skills concurrently. <br/><br/>The primary goal of this study is to identify if students in Group 1, who learn the surgeon’s surgical C-loop knot technique using a transparent shoebox before using a pelvi trainer have a shorter learning curve than students in Group 2, who learn the technique using solely a pelvi trainer.

Tutors are specially trained medical students (n=3), who are not blinded to the training group status of the trainees. Participants are randomized to the intervention (group 1) or control group (group 2). After randomization the training is in pairs who rate each other with standardized checklists for knot tying technique and quality of knot tying, as well as time. The knot tying technique is evaluated with a modified 23-point-checklist designed by Munz Y et al.. The quality of knots is evaluated with a 5-point-checklist by Muresan et al.. For evaluation of precision the distance between needle entry and exit points on the standardized suture pads is measured in millimeters as well as the time. At the beginning of training all trainees receive a standardized video instruction to the knot tying technique, followed by a detailed explanation of the checklists for knot tying technique and knot quality.

Patients are also asked to indicate the number of days they experienced pain, and the number of days they experienced strong pain, both within the previous month. Physical functioning will be assessed with the Oswestry Disability Index by Mannion et al. (2006). Also, we included a widely used German short version of the Health Survey to assess physical functioning and health-related quality of life more generally (Bullinger and Kirchberger, 1998). All of those questionnaires were assessed at T1 (beginning of Treatment), T2 (after Treatment) and T3 (6 months after Treatment). ;"Assessments of both intervention group and baseline group are identical. Patients’ attachment patterns will be assessed with the help of the relationship questionnaire (RQ 2; Bartholomew and Horowitz, 1991) and the revised Experience of Close Relationships questionnaire (Ehrenthal et al., 2009) in its newly developed German short version (ECR-RD 12; Brenk-Franz, Ehrenthal, et al. Version 1.0, 2011, personal communication) at T1 (Treatment begin) and T3 (6 months post-treatment).   To measure emotional distress, we included the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (Lovibond and Lovibond, 1995) in its German version by Nilges and colleagues at T1, T2 and T3.For the assessment of patients’ personality based on the five basic personality factors we chose the NEO-Five Factor Inventory (Costa and McCrae, 1989; German short version Körner et al., 2008) at T1. Also, we included measures of self-esteem (Rosenberg Self Esteem Scale; Rosenberg, 1965), interpersonal problems (Inventory of Interpersonal Problems, German short version; Thomas et al., 2011), coping strategies (Coping Strategies Questionnaire; Verra et al., 2006) at t1, T2 and T3, as well as patients’ subjective evaluation of the therapeutic working alliance (Working Alliance Inventory, revised German short version; Wilmers et al., 2008) at T2 (After Treatment). Additionally, we will ask patients to evaluate their overall experience with the therapeutic process (for example, their relationships with therapists and other patients during the program) with the German “Stationserfahrungsbogen” (Sammet and Schauenburg, 1999) at T2 (after Treatment).

This means that patients with insecure attachment patterns are not able to maintain the positive short-term results of multimodal pain therapy. This finding is especially relevant given that insecure attachment styles are overrepresented in patients suffering from chronic pain (Davies et al., 2009). Attachment insecurity also negatively influences the working alliance with health-care professionals (Bernecker et al., 2013), and outcome in psychosocial interventions (Levy et al., 2011).<br/>To date, the knowledge about attachment concepts has not been used to improve pain treatment outcomes with the help of a differential approach based on individual attachment styles. Therefore, we will compare the short- and long-term treatment outcomes for pain patients who will receive multidisciplinary, attachment-specific treatment with the outcomes for patients in a control group who will receive the multidisciplinary state-of-the-art treatment. ;Background<br/>The concept of attachment is relevant for the onset and development of chronic pain. Insecure attachment styles negatively affect therapeutic outcome. Insecurely attached patients seem to be less able to sustain positive effects of a multimodal treatment program. However, it has never been tested before if an attachment-oriented approach can improve treatment results of insecurely attached patients in a multimodal outpatient setting. To test this assumption, we compare the short- and long-term outcomes for pain patients who will receive multidisciplinary, attachment-oriented treatment with the outcomes for patients in a control group, who will receive the multidisciplinary state-of-the-art treatment.<br/>Methods<br/>Two patient groups (baseline, attachment intervention) are assessed before treatment, after treatment, and at a 6 month follow-up. The study is conducted in a block design: After data collection of the first block (controls) and before as well as during data collection for the second block (treatment group), the health care personnel of the outpatient pain clinic receives training on attachment theory and its use in the therapeutic context. Pain intensity as measured with visual analogue scales will serve as the primary outcome measure.<br/>Discussion<br/>The design of our study allows for a continuous exchange of experienced team members, which may help bring about concrete attachment related guidelines for the enhancement of therapeutic outcome. This would be the first attempt at an attachment-oriented improvement of multimodal pain programs.<br/>Conclusion<br/>An attachment-based approach may be a promising way to enhance long-term treatment outcomes for insecurely attached pain patients. ;Recruiting complete, follow-up complete;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;http://www.drks.de//drks_web/navigate.do?navigationId=trial.HTML&TRIAL_ID=DRKS00008715;2018-06-14T11:40:18.890+02:00;;Heidelberg;FALSE;

It is commonly measured by indirect calorimetry in free living conditions. Thus, there are several factors hardly to control and standardize as physical activity before measurements and sleeping time of the previous night. With the presented study we aimed at investigating the influence of a. moderate physical activity and b. cumulative, partial sleep restriction on resting energy expenditure in young and metabolically healthy male and female volunteers.;Measurement of resting energy expenditure (REE) under free living conditions is sensitive to confounding. For instance restrictions in sleeping time affect autonomic nerval control and endocrine function which constitute major drivers of basal metabolic rate (BMR). Acute, temporary changes in sleeping time may thus induce variations in BMR and consequently confound measurements of resting energy expenditure (REE). Also physical activity is a strong modulator of REE measurements and different levels of activity under free living conditions may induce high variations in REE measurements. The presented study therefore investigated the influence of a. a cumulative, partial sleep deprivation (5h/night for 3 consecutive nights) and b. a moderate physical activity on REE in metabolically healthy young volunteers.;Recruiting complete, follow-up complete;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;http://www.drks.de//drks_web/navigate.do?navigationId=trial.HTML&TRIAL_ID=DRKS00008755;2016-07-05T10:35:27.671+02:00;;Bonn;FALSE;

Although many studies have been conducted with different compression systems, the results are very different. This can be due to many other relevant factors like for example concomitant disease, mobility and quality of bandaging. To exclude most of the factors both compression products will be consecutively applied and measured  for each subject. The order of the products is random. Water displacement is a risk-free, non-invasive method to measure volume variations in the lower leg. This allows to evaluate the extent of the oedema and the influence of both compression products on  oedema changes.<br/>The hypothesis is that the volume reduction of the lower leg is at least the same when treated with the compression system compared to treatment with short-stretch bandages. <br/>;Quantifying the effects of therapeutic approaches of oedema requires the measurement of limb volume and volume changes.<br/>Water displacement (WD) volumetry is considered as the reference method for the quantitative evaluation of limb oedema and the effect of compression.<br/>This study is a prospective, randomized, controlled, cross-over trial to assess the volume reduction of the lower leg of subjects with chronic venous insufficiency under two different compression treatments.<br/><br/>Hypothesis: <br/>Volume reduction of the lower leg of subjects with chronic venous insuufficiency is at least the same when treated with the compression system compared to treatment with short-stretch bandages. <br/>The ankle joint mobility with the compression system is as good as with no compression device and the same or better than with short-stretch bandages.;Recruiting complete, follow-up complete;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;http://www.drks.de//drks_web/navigate.do?navigationId=trial.HTML&TRIAL_ID=DRKS00008829;2017-09-01T08:51:47.147+02:00;;Freiburg;FALSE;

In double-lumen endotracheal tube (DLT) the flow-resistance and the pressure difference between the pressure in the lungs and the airway pressure is expected to be increased during one-lung ventilation, because of the small inner diameter of the single lumen. The ventilation mode “Automatic Tube Compensation” (ATC) can potentially compensate the difference between the pressure in the lungs and the pressure at the airway opening based on measured airway pressure and flow rate. So far ATC has not been validated during intraoperative one-lung ventilation, although compensation to the intratracheal pressure is of great clinical importance. The study’s aim is to validate ATC during one-lung ventilation with a DLT. Adult Patients who undergo chest-surgery will be included in this study. Using ATC requires the temporary ventilation with an intensive care ventilator (EVITA V500, Dräger Medical, Germany). For the study one-lung ventilation will be performed without and with ATC in a consecutive order. At each ventilation period the ratio of inspiration and expiration is varied. Pressure and flow rate are recorded for a few minutes within the ventilator. This happens during surgery and does not extend the surgical intervention. Based on measured pressure and flow rate the level of dynamic hyperinflation (auto - PEEP) without and with ATC will be determined. It is the hypothesis of the study, that ventilation with ATC will reduce the level of dynamic hyperinflation (auto - PEEP) compared to the ventilation without ATC.;The study’s aim is to ventilate 41 adult patients with elective, thoracic surgery without and with the ventilation mode “Automatic Tube Compensation” (ATC) during one-lung ventilation. During controlled mechanical ventilation ATC supports the passive driven expiration, thus reducing the risk of dynamic hyperinflation (auto - PEEP). For the purpose of the study, the patients’ ventilated lung will be ventilated without and with ATC in a consecutive order, using an intensive care ventilator (EVITA V500, Dräger Medical, Germany). During both ventilation intervals the ratio of inspiration to expiration will be varied from 1:2 to 2:1 and the respective level of auto-PEEP will be calculated at each I:E ratio and ventilation mode. Airway pressure and flow rate will be recorded in the ventilator. We hypothesize that ventilation with ATC will reduce the level of dynamic hyperinflation (auto - PEEP) compared to the ventilation without ATC.;Recruiting complete, follow-up complete;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;http://www.drks.de//drks_web/navigate.do?navigationId=trial.HTML&TRIAL_ID=DRKS00008849;2016-01-11T11:36:41.461+01:00;;Freiburg;FALSE;

Therefore we want to examine the influence of an elevated positive endexspiratory pressure (PEEP) on the patients lung-mechanics. Our main indicator for the condition of the patients lung will be the so called ""compliance"". It gives us information about the flexibility of the lung and constantly changes throughout a breath. There is an approximate value the compliance should have, indicating the most lung-protective setting of the PEEP. Our group has developed a method to measure the compliance during a breath that can be used during a surgery, giving advice on how to set the PEEP to the most lung-protective magnitude.<br/>We will be using this graphical user interface (GUI) on 60 patients, of which 30 will get active modulation of their PEEP-setting. They will be compared to the other 30 patients who will be ventilated with the commonly used PEEP of 5mbar. We are assuming that a higher PEEP-setting will have a positive influence on compliance and ventilation. Throughout the artificial ventilation we will also measure the effectiveness of the ventilation using another method developed by our group. For possible recruitment patients have to be adult and lung-healthy. Only routine and planned surgery is allowed.<br/>";"Examinaton of lung-healthy patients during artificial ventilation has not yet experienced too much scientific effort. Based on recent studies we are assuming that an elevated positive endexspiratory pressure (PEEP) is likely to have a positive influence on lung-mechanics during artificial ventilation[1]. Therefore we want to figure out how much the PEEP has to be increased to achieve a maximum in lung-protection. Thus, in one group of patients PEEP will be set according to the graphical user interface (GUI) our group has developed[2]. It is using the gliding-SLICE-method, also developed by our group[3,4]. Another group of patients will get the commonly used PEEP setting of 5mbar and will serve as a comparison. For both groups, we will also be using electrical impedance tomography (EIT) to measure the quality of ventilation.<br/><br/>Literature:<br/>[1] Futier et al.

On the basis of previous study data the combination of a strength training and the intake of protein assumed an increase in muscle mass with a concomitant improvement in muscle strength . A total of 120 men have to participate in the study. In this proposed study the division into intervention groups of 40 subjects is set. In addition to performing a traditional strength training (three-set training) the participants are taking collagen peptides or placebo. Primary endpoint is the change in muscle mass through the administration of collagen peptides compared to placebo. The body composition will be detected by DEXA. In an additional test group the influence of whey protein will be examined. Besides an improvement in arm and leg strength changes in fat mass and changes in the metabolic risk profile (waist circumference, triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL - (/ LDL cholesterol, blood pressure, glucose, insulin, HbA1c, HOMA-IR, hs-CRP ) are secondary outcomes. Additionally it  is examined to what extent the effects draw a distinction between taking whey protein and collagen peptides or placebo. Participants must have an increased fat mass (> 25%) have to be clinically healthy and must be able to do an one-hour strength training three times a week by a period fully in three months. Furthermore  possible participants must not  regular exercise 60 minutes or more per week until the start of the study. In addition, no intolerance to the study products must be present. After a successful test of the inclusion and exclusion criteria based on a detailed medical history, clinical examination and a blood test the arm and leg strength measurement will be held . Randomly, the subjects are divided into three study groups (collagen peptides, whey protein and placebo). According to the manufacturer 15 grams of the investigational product (collagen peptides), the taste like placebos or the whey protein are ingested dissolved in water daily. At training days the product is taking immediately after the work out. On Days when training do not take place, the substance will be consumed at the same time as on training days during the 12-week study period. 2 examination dates take place:.. U1: initial examination U2: final examination after 12 weeks of training intervention objective of the planned double- blind placebo-controlled clinical study is the influence of sarcopenia (grade I or II) in obese men between 30 and 60 years of age by oral administration of collagen peptides;Primary endpoint of the planned double-blind placebo-controlled clinical study is the influence of the muscle mass in obese men between 30 and 60 years of age by oral administration of specific collagen peptides.

The effects will be measured by recording and analysing electroencephalogram (EEG) data before and after the stimulation.<br/><br/>What is the background of the study?<br/>Electrical stimulation is a potential treatment for epilepsy and has shown good effects in some patients. The information gained from this study will help develop a new implantable device for the treatment of epilepsy. <br/><br/>What will be done during the study?<br/>Subjects will be invited to participate in two test sessions, with one week break in between. Each test session will consist of 2.5-hour EEG recording, 20-minute active stimulation (delivered over 20 minutes for alternating current stimulation or over 100 minutes for direct current stimulation) and  2.5-hour follow-up EEG evaluation.

Therefore it should be possible to evaluate if electrical stimulation has an effect on the number of spikes (brain activity typical for epilepsy) shown in the EEG. The EEG results can then also be compared for alternating current and direct current stimulation to see which one is more effective. The seizure counts will also be evaluated.<br/><br/>What is the hypothesis?<br/>Based on the current research it is expected that even a single stimulation session may have a positive effect on the EEG activity i.e. lead to less spikes.;The main aim of this study is to assess the effects of transcranial electrical stimulation on patients suffering from refractory focal epilepsy as indexed by interictal epileptic discharges. Furthermore the study seeks to compare which stimulation mode, AC or DC is more effective in reducing epileptiform activity.

In this study two groups of patients were compared: Patients who were ventilated with an LTS II and patients who were ventilated with a concentional tracheal tube. ;The laryngeal tube suction II (LTS II) is a supraglottic airway device (SAD) with a gastric drainage tube and enhanced seal properties when compared to other SAD. Therefore, it is in use in prehospital emergency airway management and has been proposed in situations with an elevated risk for aspiration. In the presented study we investigated the safety and efficacy of airway management and controlled mechanical ventilation with a LTS II in comparison with endotracheal intubation (ET) for radical endoscopic prostate surgery. In 28 patients who were randomized for LTS II the device had to be switched to ET mainly due to airway leakage and problems with mechanical ventilation. Additionally, we detected engorgement in 3 patients and a higher but not significant incidence of severe sore throat in the LTS II group. We therefore concluded that LTS II should not be used for airway management in patients undergoing radical endoscopic prostate surgery. ;Recruiting stopped after recruiting started ;Paper;[---]*;[---]*;Eur J Anaesthesiol. 2016 Oct 27.

We plan to examine people with a former occupational exposure to carcinogenic substances, who are invited to take part in the voluntary examination after being exposed to the substances.

From our daily work, we gained the impression that many of the participants of the screening are afraid regarding critical results of the examination. The regular letter inviting the people to the screening is quite rational and does not pay attention to the background of the medical examination or possible anxiety-inducing components of the screening. The aim of the study is to find out, whether the occupational medicine screening leads to psychological distress and whether a possible distress can be influenced by modifying the invitation letter. Therefore, we modified the invitation letter and included information on the background and the process of the screening. This intervention should prevent worries due to the screening and reduce the possible psychological distress of the participants. 50 percent of the people will get the modified invitation letter. The regular invitation letter will be sent to the other half (randomized process). Every participant receives a number (ID). Before the regular medical examination starts, three questionnaires are handed out to the study participants. To analyse the amount of the psychological distress, we use Spielberger’s State-Trait-Anxiety Inventory and the SF-12. Furthermore, information about the health status and the smoking behavior will be collected. The study is two-armed and single-blind. The aim is to analyse whether the participation in the occupational medicine screening leads to a certain amount of psychological distress (state-anxiety) and whether the study population differs from the reference population. Additionally, the two groups (control and intervention group) will be compared regarding the state anxiety and the participation rate.;Recruiting complete, follow-up complete;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;http://www.drks.de//drks_web/navigate.do?navigationId=trial.HTML&TRIAL_ID=DRKS00009221;2016-08-30T16:19:27.476+02:00;;Halle;FALSE;

General Practitioners (GPs) are among the first to be contacted when secondary diseases and comorbidities arise. In addition, it has been shown that GPs advice to lose weight is a strong motivator for patients to engage in weight management strategies. However, research indicates insufficient quality of weight counseling in primary care due to negative attitudes towards obese patients and a lack of self-efficacy in weight counseling.<br/>In this project, the efficiency of an internet based learning program for providers aiming at the improvement of obesity management will be examined in a sample of GPs. The internet based learning program was developed based on the 5A’s guidance for obesity management by the Canadian Obesity Network. For the present study the 5A’s guidance for obesity management has been worked up as online tutorial for German GPs. It is planned to implement the online tutorial in co-operating primary health care practices and evaluate its effectiveness by assessing patient’s and doctor’s perspective on characteristics of weight counseling.<br/>For the present study patients with obesity will be recruited in cooperation with GP practices. Thus, the participating GP practices will be randomly allocated to an intervention group (GPs with access to the 5A online tutorial) and a control group (GPs without access to the 5A online tutorial).<br/>Patients of both groups will fill out questionnaires regarding doctor-patient-interaction, quality of life, the course of weight development, self-stigma and readiness to engage in weight management at three different assessment points (immediately after recruitment, after 6 months, after 12 months). <br/>GPs will fill out questionnaires regarding their counseling behavior, stigma concerning obesity, knowledge about obesity as a chronic condition and satisfaction with that knowledge at two different assessment points (immediately after recruitment and before access to the online tutorial, after 12 months).<br/>Changes over time of outcome measures will be compared between intervention group and control group. <br/>;"This project aims to implement and evaluate the internet based learning program “5A Adipositas Management” (The 5A’s of obesity management) to improve weight counseling within the German primary health care setting.<br/>The 5A’s of obesity management specifically focus at health care providers and were developed by the Canadian Obesity Network analog to the 5A Model of smoking cessation. The Five A’s of obesity management cover recommendations on how to discuss weight with the patient (“ASK""), assess obesity related risks and causes of weight gain (“ASSESS”), advise on treatment options (“ADVISE”), agree on weight loss expectations and treatment plan (“AGREE”) and assist the patient in the ongoing process of losing weight (“ASSIST”). For the present study the 5A’s guidance for obesity management has been implemented as online tutorial for German GPs.<br/>The study design is a cluster-randomized controlled trial, in which approximately 20 recruited general practitioners (GP) will be randomized to an intervention group (IG: GPs with access to the 5A online tutorial) and a control group (CG: GPs without access to the 5A online tutorial).

Sixty volunteers with diagnosed adhesive capsulitis were randomly allocated to press-tack acupuncture treatment or optically identical placebo press-tacks. Neither the patient nor the caregiver was aware of the type of press-tack. Acupuncture treatment was performed at reflex areas on arms and legs, avoiding local shoulder needling. There was an immediate average improvement of 3.33 points on Constant Murley Shoulder Score (CMSS) pain sub score in the treatment group and of 1.6 in the placebo group. The superiority of acupuncture treatment over placebo was statistically significant. The participants were then offered to receive 10 follow-up treatments with classical acupuncture needles. Patients who received acupuncture additionally to physiotherapy got relevant improvement within an average of 14.94 weeks while patients who received physiotherapy alone got relevant improvement within an average of 30.92 weeks. These results give evidence that acupuncture can influence the intensity of pain as well as the long term time course of adhesive capsulitis but further studies are necessary for the affirmation of these results. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>;Adhesive capsulitis (frozen shoulder) is one main reason for pain of the shoulder joint.  Adhesive capsulitis is self limiting in a period of one to four years presenting three distinct stages. The first stage is characterized by an acute synovitis of the glenohumeral joint. Most patients progress to the second stage with restriction of the range of motion and usually lasting pain. The third stage begins when the range of motion begins to improve.  Treatment  is usually symptomatical by long term intake of oral analgesic or antiphlogistic drugs beside manual therapy and physiotherapy. This study investigated the short term effect of acupuncture performed with press-tack needles on pain perception as well as the long term effect of classical acupuncture needling on the course of the disease. Sixty volunteers with adhesive capsulitis stage 1 or 2 where randomly assigned to press-tack acupuncture needles compared to optically identical placebo press-tacks in a patient and observer blinded randomized study, using acupuncture treatment on distant reflex areas avoiding local treatment.  There was an immediate improvement of 3.33± 3.2 points on Constant Murley Shoulder Score (CMSS) pain sub score in the treatment group and of 1.6 ± 2.80 in the placebo group (p <0.02).  The study confirmed that acupuncture can influence short term pain perception and that press-tack needles together with press-tack placebo are a functioning option for double blind studies in acupuncture. <br/>The participants were subsequently offered to receive 10 treatments with classical acupuncture needles over 10 weeks in an open follow up clinical application observation. Evaluation after one year showed that patients that took acupuncture additionally to physiotherapy got relevant improvement within 14.94 ±15.89 weeks compared to 30.92 ±15.81 weeks with physiotherapy alone (p< 0.005).

Ipsilesional and bihemispheric reorganization have been documented. In addition stroke patients experience an increased inhibitory influence from the contralesional to the ipsilesional motor cortex. Yet there is evidence that patients benefit from both bilateral and unilateral arm training. Therefore we want to compare the effects of bilateral versus unilateral computer-supported arm training on motor recovery in severely affected subacute stroke patients.<br/>Methods: 68 patients with a severe arm paresis (Fugl-Meyer-Score for the arm (FMA) less than 18) are recruited for this randomized single-blinded study. The bilateral arm training entailes a repetitive training on an “arm-bicycle” followed by synchronized bilateral repetitive hand training. The unilateral arm training is identical but performed by the paretic limb only. Both trainings are administered twice daily over six weeks and incorporate shaping elements.

Children with ADHD do not seem to benefit from sleep and show poorer memory performance after sleeping than healthy children do.<br/>Encoding, however, requires successful recording and integration of the content that is to be learned. This process is prone to interference and is mainly controlled by specific areas in the frontal lobe. For example, this area mainly determines which information is important and should be integrated and which is less important. Patients with ADHD often show deficits in this region that are associated with disturbed neurotransmitter metabolism. Linked to this, patients with ADHD also have problems in long-term memory tasks which are related to the altered recording process of the information through the frontal lobe. The disturbed metabolism in this area can be improved by methylphenidate (MPH), the first drug of choice in ADHD. Thus, performance in the frontal lobe can be improved. However, it has not been shown yet whether or not MPH can improve the long-term memory in patients with ADHD. <br/>Thirty-four boys with ADHD aged 9-12 years will be examined. In this study, only patients that are being treated with MPH as a part of their therapy and have already been successfully medicated for at least more than 1 year are included. Only children with an average IQ, atleast average memory capacity, healthy sleep, and no other mental health problems apart from ADHD can participate. The children spend a total of three nights in the sleep laboratory (consisting of one night to accustom themselves to the new surroundings and two study nights). During all three nights, an EEG is used to record during sleep. In the mornings before the second and third night, the children perform two learning tasks: the first task involves learning combinations of word pairs; the second task is a motor skills task. Half of the children will receive MPH in the medically prescribed dose 30 minutes prior to the learning task; the other half will receive the MPH immediately after learning. Placebo pills and pills with active ingredient are administered so that the subjects are not aware which one they receive. That is, each morning one pill is administered before and one after learning but only one of the two pills contains the active ingredient. After performing parts of the same tasks as a learning control in the evening, the night is spent at the sleep laboratory. In the morning, recall of the word pairs is tested and the motor skills task is performed a second time.<br/>We expect that the memory performance of patients with ADHD will be enhanced by the administration of MPH before learning.<br/>";The aim of this study is to describe basic mechanisms of sleep-dependent memory consolidation in children and adolescents. It intends to show that the function of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) plays a crucial role in the encoding of memory contents and thus influences the success of subsequent, sleep-dependent memory consolidation.<br/><br/>To test this hypothesis experimentally, the attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD ) is to be introduced as a model for reduced prefrontal functionality. As shown in previous studies, children and adolescents with ADHD show alterations in sleep-dependent memory consolidation. ADHD patients show impaired performance in declarative memory tasks following sleep. In contrast, sleep compensated for deficits in motor memory tasks in patients with ADHD. However, memory consolidation requires prior successful encoding of the respective memory content. Encoding as a complex process of information recording and integration is prone to interference and requires a focus of cognitive resources. The PFC plays a crucial role in the distribution of such resources. Thus, by means of motivational, PFC-controlled, and top-down regulation task-relevant information is preferably processed before task-irrelevant content. Patients with ADHD show deficits in frontal cognitive functions. In addition, poorer performance in long-term memory tasks was shown which could be mainly related to the disturbed, prefrontal-mediated encoding process. <br/>Deviations in frontal functioning in ADHD are, among others, attributed to decreased dopaminergic signaling. These alterations in the dopaminergic metabolism are improved by metylphenidate (MPH), the drug of first choice in ADHD treatment. This leads to a normalization of fronto-striatal brain activity and is accompanied by an improvement of frontal cognitive performance. Although it has been shown that the administration of MPH can increase long-term memory performance in healthy controls, it remains unclear whether MPH enhances encoding in ADHD in terms of a long-term memory performance benefit. This study aims at examining whether a manipulation of prefrontal functions during the encoding process affects subsequent sleep-dependent memory consolidation.<br/><br/>Thirty-four boys (9-12 years) with ADHD will be examined. In this study, only patients being successfully treated with MPH for at least more than 1 year are included. Further exclusion criteria are below-average intelligence, basic memory deficits, sleep disorders, or other psychological disorders. In addition to the clinical diagnostic session, the study consists of three nights in the sleep laboratory with polysomnographic monitoring (consisting of an adaptation night and two study nights). A declarative memory task (paired associates learning task) as well as a motor memory task (serial reaction time task) are used to assess the memory consolidation. The encoding is done in the morning. Depending on the condition, MPH is administered in the medically prescribed dose either 30 minutes prior to or directly after the encoding. By using placebo pills, the subjects remain blinded to the condition: Each morning one pill is given before and one after the encoding but only one of the two pills contains the active ingredient. After an encoding test in the evening, the night is spent at the sleep laboratory. The recall takes place the next morning. Prior to the recall, the normal MPH dose is administered.<br/><br/>The manipulation of prefrontal functions at the time of the encoding is expected to affect the subsequent sleep-dependent memory consolidation. We intend to show that an increase in prefrontal function at the time of encoding supports sleep-dependent consolidation of declarative memory (Δ encoding - retrieval performance), whereas the consolidation of motor memory is attenuated.<br/>;Recruiting complete, follow-up complete;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;http://www.drks.de//drks_web/navigate.do?navigationId=trial.HTML&TRIAL_ID=DRKS00009346;2020-03-04T20:30:53.023+01:00;;Kiel LÃ¼beck;FALSE;

Until now, this diagnostics can only be realized by an investigation in a sleep laboratory with electrodes and additional sensors all over the body that is very expensive and needs a lot of staff.<br/>In this study, a new method, which registers and analyses motion during sleep time, shall be examined. The Video-Kinect-System works with a three-dimensional video signal and an audio signal and allows the registration of breathing disturbances and motion disorders as well as the sleep-wake cycle. It is resource- saving and time-saving procedure. <br/><br/>There will be an examination of patients with either sleep-related respiratory disorders (obstructive sleep apnoea) or restless legs syndrome for one night in the sleep laboratory. The trial includes a sleep screening (polysomnography) together with a registration of video and audio by the tool Kinect. Furthermore, a measurement of motion with a device that is worn on the wrist (actigraphy) will take place.;"In the field of sleep medicine there is no objective neurological screening tool. The decision, which patients need further diagnostics, is made by the symptoms.<br/>The polysomnography with monitoring of electroencephalogram (EEG), electrooculogram (EOG), electromyogram (EMG), electrocardiogram (ECG), breathing, oxygen concentration of blood, position of body, and leg movements is the gold standard of diagnostics of sleep medicine disorders. However, it is very time-consuming and expensive and it can be a larger organizational burden for the patient (e. g. because of absence at work).<br/>The present study examine, whether a three-dimensional videometry and audiometry with the system Video-KinectTM (Microsoft Corp.) can be used as a diagnostic instrument for sleep disorders to detect periods of disturbed respiration (apnoea and hypopnea), pathological leg movements (periodic limb movements) and to assess sleep quality and continuity of sleep. Up to now, it was multiple times successfully applied during daytime for motion analysis of neurological disorders.<br/>To achieve this, we will record and analyse, in addition to polysomnography, the movements of 60 study participants while sleep time via Video KinectTM on a contactless way. Subsequently, there will be a comparison of the parameters of the polysomnography concerning depth of sleep, quality of sleep and sleep disturbance.<br/>Furthermore, the participants will wear an actigraph at the not dominant wrist that registers and records movements with an integrated acceleration sensor and simultaneously serves as a reference for measurement of movement.<br/>There will be an examination of 20 patients with obstructive sleep apnea, 20 patients with restless legs syndrome and 20 subjects with healthy sleep for one night in sleep laboratory.<br/>The measurement with Video KinectTM during sleep time is a method that is not very stressful, that is resource-saving and contactless. Hence, it does not influence the sleeping habits of the patients. On one hand, it will be possible to do a sleep screening in the home environment; and on the other hand, multiple measurements are feasible in an easy way, if the screening with the Kinect will turn out to be diagnostically valuable. Therefore, sleep disorders that vary from night to night or do not arise every night, could be easier diagnosed by Video KinectTM.";Recruiting complete, follow-up complete;Paper;[---]*;https://link.springer.com/journal/11818/21/2/suppl;Veauthier C, Ryczewski J, Mansow-Model S, Otte K, Kayser S, Glos M, Paul F, Brandt A, Penzel T (2017) Kontaktlose Schlafüberwachung von Patienten mit OSAS und RLS.

In addition to the presence of pathogens in the oral flora, additional factors such as coverage of the mucosa by removable dentures (prosthesis) are given. Apart from asymptomatic infection with e.g. redness and / or benign overgrowth of the mucosa, patients may experience discomfort such as burning of the mouth. The established diagnosis consists in oral smear sampling followed by microscopic examination. Pathogens are identified and quantified. The findings obtained in this way are the basis for subsequent drug antimicrobial therapy. In particular, since the cultivation of pathogens is time-consuming, this results in a delay to the start of treatment.<br/>Previous laboratory tests showed that smallest volatile substances, so-called volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are released by pathogens of oral candidiasis. This appears to be a possible new diagnostic approach, since in the presence of clinical signs of infection and detection of pathogen-specific VOCs in exhaled breath, a diagnosis could be made quicker than in the context of the described microbiological laboratory diagnostics. For the diagnosis of other diseases (e.g. tuberculosis) such breath tests already have been established. <br/>If it is possible to demonstrate that after the completion of drug treatment, the above-mentioned specific substances are no longer detectable in the breath, the implementation of a breath test could be possible. With the help of such a breath test, time-saving diagnostics could be performed resulting in faster treatment.;Recruiting complete, follow-up complete;Paper;[---]*;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28601915;Volatile organic compounds in the breath of oral candidiasis patients: a pilot study.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;http://www.drks.de//drks_web/navigate.do?navigationId=trial.HTML&TRIAL_ID=DRKS00009391;2017-10-09T14:28:43.483+02:00;;Berlin;FALSE;

At the same time, each year about 40,000 patients die because of malignancy in this area. The prognosis is still bad, despite numerous advances in surgical and multimodal therapies in the last decades.<br/>This is largely due to the fact that patients with tumors in this region are without any symptoms because of the endophytic growth for a long time. They consult doctors / dentists late (Patients delay) According to recent studies, the time span from the first realization of changes to the diagnosis is about  six months.<br/>This results in the fact that 50% of patients are in an intermediate or advanced stage of the disease at diagnosis. But the early diagnosis of the SCCHN is  of fundamental importance for the prognosis of patients. During early stages (UICC stage I, II) patients can be cured with single operational and radiotherapeutic approaches in up to 90%, the 5- year survival rate for the intermediate (III) and advanced stages (IV) drops to 40% or even below 10%.<br/>This illustrates the urgent need for research to improve the prognosis. In recent decades, the main focus of research has been addressed to the optimization of therapy, but still the prognosis for advanced stages is poor. For the early detection of head and neck malignancies, besides clinical inspection, there is no testing procedure.  A simple, non-invasive screening test, which is capable of both - not yet recognized tumors at an early stage, asymptomatic recurrences - has not yet been established.<br/>The review of the possibility of developing such a non-invasive detection test as a breath test is the aim of this study.;With the help of a breath test, head and neck tumors could be diagnosed and treated earlier. This would be have a positive impact on the prognosis. Additionally, such a breath test could also be used for the early detection of recurrences of the tumor.<br/>At the moment, early diagnosis of a tumor in the head and neck region is a problem, as patients usually have no symptoms. Often, general dentists find suspicious lesions and send their patients to specialized clinics. <br/>This circumstance means that currently the majority of patients is already at an advanced stage of the disease at diagnosis. A non-invasive, fast and simple breath test could overcome this problem by regularly screening and monitoring risk patients.<br/>The second approach of the breath test is its use in the monitoring of patients relapse after completion of treatment. The guideline on the diagnosis and treatment of head and neck tumors after treatment (surgery and/or radio-/chemotherapy) in the first five years requires a yearly computer tomography. In addition to ultrasound and clinical examination this procedure is gold standard due to its high reliability in the detection of recurrences, despite its high levels of radiation. MRI scans is rarely used because of their limited availability. The breath test could replace the standard CT examination in the recurrence control, thus reducing the radiation exposure of patients significantly.<br/>The aim of this pilot study is to evaluate the feasibility of such a breath test in clinical routine <br/>Therefore, three approaches for the detection of specific volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Via gas chromatography and mass spectrometry breath samples will be screened for tumor-specific VOCs described in the literature. Moreover, conspicuous peaks in the mass spectrograms are analyzed in order to assign an organic compound. The third approach is to create difference chromatograms comparing the breath samples after and before the tumor operation.;Recruiting complete, follow-up complete;Paper;[---]*;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0194599817711411; Volatile Organic Compounds in the Breath of Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma Patients: A Pilot Study  Stefan Hartwig, MD, DMD, , Jan D.

The stroke volume is an important parameter for global tissue perfusion and cardiac output and has a great value for goal-directed hemodynamic therapy for patients undergoing surgery or for intensive care medicine. Continuous and validated hemodynamic monitoring is a key for goal-directed volume therapy and can result in improved postoperative outcome. In contrast to established monitoring devices hemodynamic parameters are generated non-invasive by using a piezo-foil placed on the patient´s finger. The project aims the development of algorithms for measuring blood pressure and further hemodynamic paramters with this technology.;The aim if this study is to develop and validate a new monitoring device based on the piezo-foil technology placed on the patient’s finger to estimate arterial blood pressure, stroke volume and pulse pressure variation non-invasively. The study facilitates the complete new development of algorithms for determining the above mentioned parameters from sensor data and the electrocardiogram. The aim of this project is to develop an easy to use and non-invasive system.<br/>In summary, the purpose of this study is to develop and validate a software algorithm for measuring arterial blood pressure, stroke volume and furhter hemodynamic parameters using the piezo-foil technology by comparative measurements with an established invasive monitoring system in the perioperative setting. <br/>;Recruiting complete, follow-up complete;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;http://www.drks.de//drks_web/navigate.do?navigationId=trial.HTML&TRIAL_ID=DRKS00009546;2018-05-03T10:16:49.359+02:00;;Berlin;FALSE;

Psoriasis can occur anywhere on the skin and its appendages, including the nails. When psoriasis involves the nails, it is often the cause of unpleasant appearance, nail fragility, pain and other discomforts.<br/><br/>Nail involvement in psoriasis is common and the main psoriatic features in the nails are punctuate small, funnel-shaped  depressions (pitting), discoloration of the nails, detachment of the nail plate from the bed, as well as thickening of the tissue below the nail plate.<br/><br/>Nail psoriasis is not a dangerous condition: it is not life threatening, but can be a very bothersome condition and it takes a long time to heal. There are no approved topical treatments on the market specifically indicated for nail psoriasis. Usually a fingernail takes six months to completely re-grow. Therefore any treatment of this condition will take considerable time, (at least six months), to produce a clearly visible result.<br/><br/>The purpose of this trial is to provide the sponsor, physicians and patients with more information regarding the efficacy and safety of the study medication. The investigational product (called P-3073)  is a new nail solution with Calcipotriol as the active substance for the treatment of mild to moderate psoriatic fingernail(s). P-3073 is under development by the Company Polichem S.A., Lugano (Switzerland). <br/><br/>The active ingredient of the nail solution, Calcipotriol, a well-known active substance against psoriasis, is though, only available on the market as a medication for the local treatment of psoriasis of the skin. Medication for the local treatment of nails affected by psoriasis is not available. There is a medical need for a local treatment of mild to moderate signs and symptoms of nail psoriasis, where the use of other systemic (= affecting the whole body or many organs) products such as those containing cortisone, for example, (= medication reacting oninflammatory reactions, pain, hyperactivity of the immune system) are not recommended. <br/><br/>The investigational product P-3073 contains a carrier substance (also known as “vehicle”), that through the local application of the investigational product, enables the active substance Calcipotriol to penetrate easier into the nail and directly reach the area where it combats the cause of nail psoriasis.  <br/> <br/>In this study the investigational product P-3073 will be compared with an identical nail solution called placebo that does not contain a substance against psoriasis, but has the same carrier substance and is therefore known as a “vehicle”.<br/>P-3073 nail solution containing either calcipotriol as active drug (named P-3073) at a concentration of 0.005% or vehicle (placebo), identical to the study medication in appearance but without any antipsoriatic activity.<br/><br/>The patient will be requested to apply P-3073 or Vehicle (=placebo) once a day for 24 weeks of treatment. The patient will apply P-3073 or Vehicle (Placebo) on dry nail/s, after shower or bath, before bedtime. A single thin layer of the product shall be applied, by means of the applicator in the cap of the glass bottle, over the entire nail plate and 5 mm of surrounding skin and under the free edge of the nail.<br/><br/>The solution dries in approximately 30 seconds. After nail solution application, the nails should not be washed for at least 6 hours because the product is easily removed by water. After 6 hours, normal hygienic measures can be followed.<br/>P-3073 or Vehicle (Placebo) shall be applied to all affected fingernails, maximum 10 fingernails. <br/><br/>The patients will be randomly allocated to one treatment group (randomization). <br/>The probability to be assigned to the active treatment regimen is 50%, like flipping a coin. The study is double- blind, this means that neither the patient nor the investigator will know the treatment the patient are applying.<br/><br/><br/><br/>;"Psoriasis is a genetically predetermined hyper-proliferative skin disease characterized by increased cell proliferation, glycogen accumulation and incomplete differentiation in cells of the epidermis.<br/> <br/>The diagnosis of psoriasis can be determined clinically and histologically, if needed. Before treatment for psoriasis can be initiated, the grading and severity must be determined and the treatment (topical or systemic) should be chosen according to the “Psoriasis Area and Severity Index” (PASI) and/or the “Body Surface Area” (BSA). Patients with PASI values ≤ 10 are not indicated for systemic treatment.<br/><br/>Nail involvement in psoriasis is common and has been reported in about 50% of cases with a lifetime incidence estimated to be between 80 and 90%. The main psoriatic features in the nails are: pitting, discoloration of the nail, onycholysis, subungual hyperkeratosis, nail plate abnormalities and splinter hemorrhages.<br/><br/>Nail psoriasis is difficult to treat because of the location of the disease, the recurring nature of its symptoms, and treatment non-compliance. There are important adverse consequences on patients’ quality-of-life and treatments are often not effective.<br/><br/>There is an unsatisfied medical need for the treatment of mild-to-moderate prescriptive topical treatment of the signs and symptoms of nail localization of psoriatic lesions, where the use of systemic products, such as biologics or corticosteroids, is not recommended and no topical product is available. Unfortunately, no standard of care therapeutic regimen exists.<br/><br/>The Medical Board of the National Psoriasis Foundation recommends four different treatment scenarios: the use of topical or systemic treatment, including biologics is based on the severity of the pathology.<br/><br/>Calcipotriol is commonly used for the topical treatment of skin psoriasis. <br/>To date, there is in the international literature a number of clinical trials done with no specific nail formulation containing 0.005% calcipotriol (i.e., cream or ointment) in patients with nail psoriasis. Overall, 244 patients with nail localization of psoriasis have been included in 9 clinical studies and treated with 0.005% calcipotriol cream or ointment twice daily for 3-6 months, alone or in combination with other products. The rate of efficacy, in terms of improvement of signs and symptoms of nail psoriasis, ranged between 50% and 80% of treated patients. Calcipotriol 0.005% cream was effective in potentiating the efficacy of oral cyclosporine and, applied once daily on the affected nails in combination with corticosteroids, it showed similar efficacy as calcipotriol alone applied twice daily.<br/><br/>The most frequent adverse experiences reported were irritation and burning at the application site in approximately 1.2% of treated patients for both events. Erythema and diffuse urticaria were also observed in 0.41% of patients treated for nail psoriasis.<br/><br/>Since no standard of care exists for the treatment of nail psoriasis, Polichem S.A. developed a novel product (P-3073), a water based solution containing calcipotriol 0.005% in hydroxypropyl-chitosan (HPCH) as a film forming agent. The formulation is designed to maintain the active ingredient in contact with the nail plate for up to 24 hours, thereby achieving drug concentrations in the nail plate and nail bed sufficient to mitigate the signs and symptoms of psoriatic nails. <br/>After application on dry nails P-3073 evaporates quickly and the active ingredient (calcipotriol) permeates the nail lamina. The application is permeable to moisture and air; it is easily removed with water, thereby avoiding any nail damage induced by the use of nail polish and organic solvents.<br/><br/>HPCH vehicle is currently used worldwide by Polichem S.A. in several products indicated for treatment of onychomycosis and onychodystrophy. <br/>Nonclinical toxicology studies with P-3073 calcipotriol nail solution evidenced lack of irritation potential on skin or eyes and no skin sensitization at a drug concentrations 10 times higher than those expected for human use. On the basis of data generated in 28-day dermal toxicity studies performed in rabbits and minipigs, it can be concluded that P-3073 calcipotriol 0.005% medicated nail solution demonstrated no relevant signs of toxicity when dermally applied.<br/><br/>To evaluate the hypothesis of the efficacy of P-3073 nail solution in the treatment of nail psoriasis, a phase II study to compare P 3073 versus placebo and versus another active compound, P-3072 containing cyclosporine 5%, was performed. Eighty-three patients (34 in the P-3073 group, 30 in the P-3072 group and 14 in the vehicle) affected by nail psoriasis in at least one fingernail were enrolled in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial and treated once daily for 24 weeks. Patients were also evaluated after a follow-up period of 12 weeks. The changes in clinical signs of the nail bed (salmon patch, onycholysis, hyperkeratosis and splinter hemorrhage) and of the nail matrix (pitting, leukonychia, red spots in lunula, nail plate crumbling) were evaluated by means of NAPSI score at the end of treatment and at the follow-up visit.<br/><br/>The results showed that the change of NAPSI score, of the QoL and of the other clinical outcomes such as discomfort indicated a strong and statistical trend for P-3073 efficacy and no effects of P-3072.<br/><br/>P-3073, used in clinical trials, was safe and did not affect calcium metabolism. From Polichem data on file, the average amount of nail solution applied in adults per week, if ten nails are involved, is 700 mg, containing 35 mcg of calcipotriol, much lower than the approved weekly dose of 100 g of cream, corresponding to 5 mg of calcipotriol, in calcipotriol products for skin psoriasis.<br/><br/>Based on results of the phase II clinical study, Polichem planned this randomized clinical trial (RCT) phase III study versus vehicle to confirm the clinical efficacy and safety of P-3073 in patients affected by isolated psoriatic nail(s) and/or those with psoriatic nails and concomitant mild-to-moderate plaque psoriasis.  <br/>";Recruiting complete, follow-up complete;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;http://www.drks.de//drks_web/navigate.do?navigationId=trial.HTML&TRIAL_ID=DRKS00009547;2017-04-24T16:09:05.857+02:00;;Heidelberg Kiel LÃ¼beck;FALSE;

For this reason, nerve blocks as highly efficient analgesic methods are well established.<br/>The standard of care for regional anesthesia/analgesia after shoulder surgery, so far, has been the injection of local anesthetic areound the nerve plexus at the neck, from where nerves to shoulder, arm, hand and diaphragm originate. This procedure is highly effective, but certain complications and side effects have to be considered. These can impair the patient's mobility for 24 hours after surgery because of a motor block of the hand. Shortness of breath as a result of transient impairment of diaphragmatic function may also lead to hospitalization.<br/>This investigation tests whether the nerve block of a single, more peripheral, nerve innervating the shoulder will lead to comparable analgesia but greater patient satisfaction and less impairment of mobility, when compared to the standard block at the neck. Patients will be asked for written informed consent and afterwards randomized to receive either the new, more peripheral, nerve block or the standard nerve block at the neck.<br/>Both nerve blocks will be performed under sonographic guidance of needle.

Stimulation will be applied locally to the skin surface with magnitude of amperage being set before each treatment.  ;A novel approach to treat cancer pain with few side effects could be developed in the form of low frequency electrostimulation using a matrix electrode. This technique could support the pharmacological drug therapy and ultimately help to reduce the amount of conventional pain relief medication needed to maintain a pain free state thus minimizing unpleasant side effects. In a previous study, we were able to show that 4 Hz- intracutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (IENS) with matrix array electrodes leads to mechanical hypoesthesia and reduces deep pain sensitivity. This finding is consistent with the concept of centrally mediated heterosynaptic long term depression (LTD) in the human nociceptive system. Based on this finding we developed a wearable matrix electrode and used the concept of intracutaneous stimulation on patients suffering from deep tissue originating chronic pain. In the current study we aimed at proving the efficacy of pain reduction by a wearable matrix electrode in chronic cancer pain. <br/>;Recruiting complete, follow-up complete;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;http://www.drks.de//drks_web/navigate.do?navigationId=trial.HTML&TRIAL_ID=DRKS00009614;2016-06-27T10:02:21.173+02:00;;Bonn;FALSE;

Drain placement (silicon tube) is considered as standard, although there is no evidence for its value. The drain should allow wound fluid or urine, which leaks out of the injured kidney, to flow off. Other surgical trials could prove, that there are also drawbacks of wound drains. They can cause infection or pain and even injure other organs. <br/>The aim of this study is to evaluate whether drain placement is required during open partial nephrectomy, by comparing patients with and without a drain. <br/>;Nephron sparing surgery in the sense of partial nephrectomy is the therapy of choice for small renal masses. Beside minimal invasive approaches open partial nephrectomy (OPN) remains the most frequently applied technique in the US and Europe. During OPN drain placement is performed routinely. It is believed to assure drainage of urinary leakage, especially when the collecting system (CS) has been opened during tumor resection. Insertion of a drain is considered as standard, although the evidence for its value is rare. In fact studies could even identify possible drawbacks of intraoperative drain placements especially in abdominal surgery. Complications related to the synthetic tubes include infection, retained drain fragments, pain or even sever incidents like bowl entrapment and herniation, that cause significant postoperative morbidity. <br/>Evidence that large operations can be performed without drain insertion comes from gastrointestinal surgery, where randomized trails could even prove a benefit of omitting a drain.<br/>There is some evidence concerning the requirement of a drain placement during OPN from retrospective studies. However, it remains unclear, whether a drain is an added value for the patient.<br/>The aim of our study was to prospectively address the question, whether the placement of drain during OPN is required.<br/>;Recruiting complete, follow-up complete;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;http://www.drks.de//drks_web/navigate.do?navigationId=trial.HTML&TRIAL_ID=DRKS00009688;2015-11-17T11:19:33.038+01:00;;Mannheim;FALSE;

Its advantage is a faster onset and offset of platelet inhibition compared to orally given durgs. <br/>As patients require a continuous platelet inhibition also after  the coronary intervention, the intravenous therapy with cangrelor have to be transitioned to orally given platelet inhibitors. However, the ideal point of time for the first oral loading dose is not well defined.

Since the alienation from the body plays and important role in schizophrenia, embodied therapies, such as Dance and Movement Therapy (DMT) or Body Psychotherapy (BPT), may be helpful to address and explain the mental illness. The present randomized controlled study examines the effectiveness of manualized movement therapy (BPT/DMT) on the negative symptoms, particularly on flat affect, of patients with schizophrenia. Sixty-eight (N=68) out-patients with a diagnosis of a schizophrenia spectrum disorder were randomly assigned to either the treatment group (n = 44, 10 weeks of BPT/DMT) or the control group (n = 24, without BPT/DMT). Changes in negative symptoms were analyzed controlling for side effects of antipsychotic medication.<br/>After ten weeks of movement therapy, patients had significantly lower negative symptoms (SANS total score, blunted affect, attention). Effect sizes were moderate and mean symptom reduction in the treatment group was 20.65%. Compared to recent findings concerning the efficacy of anti-psychotic medication the results indicate that embodied therapies, such as BPT/DMT, are currently the only treatment consistently reducing negative symptoms of schizophrenia.<br/>;Objective. Negative symptoms of patients with Schizophrenia are highly resistant to medical treatment or conventional group therapy. Apprehending schizophrenia as a form of disembodiment of the self, a number of scientists have argued that the approach of embodiment and associated embodied therapies, such as Dance and Movement Therapy (DMT) or Body Psychotherapy (BPT), may be more suitable to explain the psychopathology underlying the mental illness and to address its symptoms. Hence the present randomized controlled trial aimed to examine the effectiveness of manualized movement therapy (BPT/DMT) on the negative symptoms of patients with schizophrenia.<br/>Method. A total of 68 out-patients with a diagnosis of a schizophrenia spectrum disorder were randomly allocated to either the treatment (n = 44, 10 weeks of BPT/DMT) or the control condition (n = 24, treatment as usual (TAU)). Changes in negative symptom scores on the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS) were analyzed using Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) with Simpson-Angus Scale (SAS) scores as covariates in order to control for side effects of antipsychotic medication.<br/>Results. After ten weeks of treatment (BPT/DMT or TAU), patients receiving movement therapy had significantly lower negative symptom scores (SANS total score, blunted affect, attention). Effect sizes were moderate and mean symptom reduction in the treatment group was 20.65%.<br/>Conclusion.

It is broadly accepted that the majority before getting AD pass through a preclinical phase of AD which is characterized by mild cognitive impairment (MCI).  Early recognition and differential diagnosis, which represent an important prerequisite for an optimized therapy, can be facilitated considerably by neuroimaging.<br/>For better understanding of the correlation of brain structural changes and changes in brain perfusion in our study clinical and neuropsychological examinations are done and a MRI will be conducted to evaluate exactly the brain tissue. Perfusion measurements and the presentation of cerebral blood vessels are used. So it is possible to detect conclusions of the process of the disease.<br/>Subjects with MCI and minor Alzheimers Disease are examined and receive a single MRI: Gadobutrol (Gadovist®) enhanced dynamic susceptibility MR perfusion (DSC-MRP) and spin-labeling technique (ASL-MRP) sequences. 10 mentally healthy age matched subjects will serve as a reference.<br/>;Although Gadobutrol (Gadovist®) is approved for multiple indications, including CNS imaging and MRA and multiple studies exist about the use of Gadobutrol in perfusion, there is only limited evidence about the performance of the agent in perfusion imaging in subjects with mental decline like MCI or minor AD. The study is therefore twofold: First we will compare the two perfusion methods in the same subject and second we will assess the role of perfusion imaging in MCI and minor AD by comparing the perfusion results with normal age matched mentally healthy control subjects. The acquired perfusion data will be assessed in an independent off-site assessment using qualitative and quantitative parameters to assess the performance of contrast enhance MRP vs. ASL perfusion.<br/>Adult subjects with clinically suspected or known dementing disorders, still able to give their informed consent, like MCI and minor AD, will be included in the study. All subjects will undergo a detailed neuropsychological testing and Mini-Mental Score Examination (MMSE) before entering the study protocol. As a reference 10 mentally healthy control subjects will be included.

We will compare this method of electronic learning (E-Learning) with video learning material utilizing a ""regular"" bystander view. Medical Students in their clinical years will be assessed regarding training success when learning laparoscopic suturing and knot tying in order to compare these E-Learning approaches. ";Surgical proficiency is highly dependent on continuous and efficient training. However, efficacy of training hinges on questions such as individual preferences, accessibility and how intuitively the training can be translated into reality. Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) in particular relies on adequate training modalities in order to compensate for its additional psychomotor and visuospatial challenges. To date, there are many noteworthy approaches to optimize training, thereby improving operation times as well as patient outcomes. Nevertheless, the increasing demand for both minimally invasive procedures and well-versed surgeons longs for further enhancement of training curricula and steep learning curves. Based on contingent findings in human mirror system research and experiences made with a new generation of medical trainees native to multimedia and computer games, we are investigating a nouveau training concept that comprises elements of ‘Serious Gaming’ and continuously utilizes the first person view. We hypothesize that laparoscopic skills can be learned without constant expert guidance and that the use of the first person perspective to be more intuitive thus faster and more naturally to apprehend than a simple laparoscopic view and aim to establish a new standard guideline to implement into a current training curricula. ;Recruiting complete, follow-up complete;Paper;[---]*;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00464-019-06842-7;Original Article;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;http://www.drks.de//drks_web/navigate.do?navigationId=trial.HTML&TRIAL_ID=DRKS00009997;2020-03-16T14:27:22.902+01:00;;Heidelberg;FALSE;

As a result of inactivity, deformity, injury or pain they often lead to restricted mobility and reduced independency in the everyday life of elderly persons. In spite of having far-reaching consequences, joint contractures are scientifically not well understood, neither in the clinical nor in the homecare setting. The Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich and the Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg have developed a complex intervention to improve functioning, social participation and quality of life of concerned persons, called “Contracture Sensitive Care”. The objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and feasibility of the developed intervention “Contracture Sensitive Care” in persons in nursing homes. The participating nursing homes will be assigned randomly to an intervention or control group. In the facilities assigned to the intervention group, “Contracture Sensitive Care” will be implemented in addition to usual care. In the facilities assigned to the control group, brief information session about meaning and consequences of contractures will be given.<br/>;Background: <br/>Joint contractures are frequent in older individuals in geriatric care settings. Joint contractures negatively affect quality of life and functioning of involved persons. Rising awareness for this subject in the last years has increased assessment and documentation requirements. The use of preventive measures with unknown effectiveness has increased. The situation of older people suffering from joint contractures in nursing homes needs more scientific awareness, in particular concerning activities of daily living and social participation. <br/><br/>Objective: <br/>The objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and feasibility of a complex intervention to improve social participation of nursing home residents with joint contractures. <br/><br/>Methods: <br/>Overall six nursing homes from two different German regions will be included in this cluster-randomized controlled trial. The primary outcome is social participation of nursing home residents with joint contractures. As secondary outcomes, restrictions in activity, quality of life, activities of everyday life and security measures for residents relating to falls and fall-related fractures will be evaluated. Process evaluation will be conducted using quantitative and qualitative methods.<br/><br/>Expected results: <br/>We expect important knowledge on the acceptance, feasibility and usefulness of our complex intervention. Barriers and facilitators of implementation will be identified. The comparison of the intervention and control group will allow first estimates of the effect size and generate information for the sample size calculation.<br/>;Recruiting complete, follow-up complete;trial protocol (mandatory for transfer to Studybox);[---]*;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4507065/;Müller, M., Bartoszek, G., Beutner, K., Klingshirn, H., Saal, S., Stephan, A.-J., Strobl, R., Grill, E., Meyer, G.

In Germany more and more of the kindergartners and primary school children are already overweight. The causes for overweight and obesity are multimodal. Not only genetic predisposition but also lifestyle factors can be held responsible for the increasing prevalence of overweight and obesity: little physical activity and an excessive intake of calories. There are various negative environmental conditions which could influence childhood development negatively. Overweight children and adolescents run a higher risk of being overweight as adults in comparison to their normal-weight contemporaries, which is why they suffer more often from obesity associated diseases like diabetes mellitus than normal-weight children. <br/>The fact that both the impairments on health as well as the psychosocial impact which are closely linked to overweight and the difficulties of mostly insufficient therapeutic measures show the urgent need of prevention. <br/>Kindergarten is a powerful setting for long-term and comprehensive measures: at low cost and with hardly any resources, many children can easily be reached. The study ""Join the healthy boat - kindergarten"" is a project promoting a healthy lifestyle in kindergartners. The study is designed for a one year intervention in the setting kindergarten with the main topics of promoting physical activity, reducing the consumption of sweetened drinks and reducing the time spent in front of computer and television screens. For this, special pre-instructed lessons have been developed. The effects of this intervention will be examined in the kindergarten year 2016/2017.<br/>The group which received the intervention for one year is compared with a control group without intervention.";"""Join the healthy boat - kindergarten"" is a health program to prevent overweight in Germany.

The program’s goal is the increase of physical activity of kindergartners, the reduction of consumption of sweetened drinks as well as the reduction of time spent in front of computers and TVs. The statewide spread of the program is realized by project delivery consultants: for each of the 44 districts of Baden-Württemberg child care workers are trained by the university staff who then continue to organize further training courses for child care workers in their region.<br/>In the course of this program, efficacy and cost effectiveness of the intervention is examined in a randomized two-arm longitudinal fashion (HEALTH SURVEY). This means that the group which received the intervention for one year is compared with a control group without intervention. The randomization occurs by kindergartens. Furthermore, measurements are taken at two points: September/October 2016 (Baseline measurements); September/October 2017 (Follow-Up measurements). Hereby, the so called waiting control group design is used which means that in one group of kindergartens the program is carried out during the kindergarten year 2016/2017 (intervention group) whereas the other group of kindergartens do not receive any intervention, yet (control group).

Aside from psychological, cardiovascular, vegetative and other reactions, stress has an effect on gene expression and post-transcriptional mechanisms via epigenetic regulation. Micro-RNAs (miRNA) play an important role in this process by regulating gene expression in fundamental cellular processes, including neurophysiological stress coping reactions. miRNAs are also actively exported from mammalian cells and are stably present in most body fluids, including peripheral blood and saliva. This suggests their usefulness in body fluids as potential biomarkers. Stability of miRNAs is ascribed to their inclusion in lipid or lipoprotein complexes such as exosomes. To date the use of disease-associated miRNAs as biomarkers or as indicators of stress reactions has mostly been limited to miRNAs in peripheral blood. However, as harvesting salivary miRNAs is non-invasive; this approach might be more feasible for biomarker assessment and monitoring.

In addition to their physical problems, a lot of these people struggle with emotional strains or stress in their social life. Medical reviewers of the pension insurance make the decision on their rehabilitation application. For different reasons they seldom can identify these problems and cannot consider them in the choice of the type of rehabilitation. That’s why in a lot of cases their physical problems are treated but they get less support for their emotional/social problems during medical rehabilitation. Maybe thas causes that they don’t feel good enough after rehabilitation, and cannot work anymore ore more often apply for pension.<br/>In our project we let the patients with muscular- or skeletal diseases fill out a very short questionnaire (UKS) before they apply for rehabilitation. With the help of this questionnaire we want to helb the medical reviewers to find out if the patients have emotional and/or social strains.

Musculoskeletal diseases constitute one third of benefits for medical rehabilitation financed through statuory pension insurance wherein the most common diagnoses of this group show a demonstrably increased psychosocial comorbidity. In the referral process for medical rehabilitation these psychosocial probelms are detected insufficiently or too late which leads to non-need-based referral to health relevant interventions and thereby to unfavorable sociomedical progressions (high rates of unemployment and pension application) of this subgroup after rehabilitation. <br/><br/>STUDY DESIGN: <br/>This study is a controlled, randomized intervention study with double-blinding, wherein the psychosocial strains (comorbidity) of rehabilitation applicants with musculoskeletal diseases (ICD-10: M00-99) is assessed through two instruments in the application period: the short screening UKS already in primary care (t0) as well as a questionnaire including health-related items after receiving the application decision (t1). Thereby the reliability of the instrument UKS is tested. By monitoring the referral processes through feedback of the DRV reviewers, the influence of the UKS on the decision on a specific rehabilitation concept as well as its future possible implementation is examined.<br/><br/>METHOD: <br/>Patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria are supposed to be recruited in primary care (general practioner/orthopedist), where they receive a study folder containing the necessary documents. The UKS (t0-questionnaire) should be filled out at the time of rehabilitation application and enclosed with the application letter addressed to the DRV MD. The reviewers then inform the scientists of their referral decision (pseudonymized through patient-ID and reviewer-ID) by means of a documentation form, which in the intervention group also includes questions on the practicability of the screening. <br/>The t1-questionnaire, to be filled out by patients after receiving the application decision, contains sociodemographic and sociomedical information as well as questions on the participant’s physical and psychological health. The latter are used to compare to the UKS and thereby determine its reliability and validity.<br/>Through the evaluation by participating doctors and DRV reviewers the realizability and accordingly a possible future implementation of the screening will be assessed. <br/><br/>DATA SOURCES:<br/><br/>1) t0-short screening UKS (filled out by patient)<br/>2) questionnaire at t1 (filled out by patient)<br/>3) documentation form for sociomedical reviewers (referral decision, evaluation of screening)<br/>4) evaluation of the method by the doctors<br/>;Recruiting complete, follow-up complete;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;http://www.drks.de//drks_web/navigate.do?navigationId=trial.HTML&TRIAL_ID=DRKS00010157;2018-04-25T12:40:35.613+02:00;;Halle;FALSE;

These stress factors can be harmful for body and well-being. The amount of diagnosed mental illnesses and the subjective perception of stress accelerated as well. Therefore, there is an urgent need for appropriate measures for stress management that meet students' requirements.  <br/>StudiCare aims to reduce perceived stress and strain. It targets students who are seeking help in order to cope with personal and academic problems and to deal with difficult emotions. The aim of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of the one based, guided self-help concept compared to a waitlist control group. Participants receive feedback on demand from an online coach.;Stress at university is associated with a variety of mental and emotional problems, such as reduced work performance, exhaustion or anxiety. Self-help interventions offer an easier access to the student target group than face-to-face interventions. Especially online and internet based self-help interventions are the method of choice for stress students that tend to avoid formal therapeutical help. The aim of the study is to assess the efficacy and possible moderators and mediators of an internet-based stress management program for students. Within the framework of an prospective, randomized control study students (N=150) experiencing a high levels of stress will be randomly allocated into either the intervention group which gains access to the seven session intervention immediately or a waitlist control group which receives the intervention 3 months later. Participants will train on a weekly basis. After the 3 month follow-up, the participants of the waitlist control group also gets access to the intervention. The intervention is based on problem- and emotion-focused stress management according to Lazarus and contains systematic problem solving as well as effective emotion regulation strategies and practices concerning acceptance and tolerance, relaxation exercise, effective self-support and mindfulness. Participants will receive feedback on demand from an online coach and will be supported through mobile components in their daily life. Data are collected at baseline, at seven weeks and three months post randomization. Perceived stress is measured as a primary outcome. Secondary outcomes include symptoms of depression, anxiety, self-compassion, maladaptive perfectionism, presenteeism and worrying/rumination. ;Recruiting complete, follow-up complete;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;http://www.drks.de//drks_web/navigate.do?navigationId=trial.HTML&TRIAL_ID=DRKS00010212;2017-03-23T17:07:58.406+01:00;;Erlangen;FALSE;

Numerous studies demonstrated a good effect of reduction of spasticity and with good tolerability 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. In order to increase the effectiveness in terms of joint mobility and reduction of spasticity further, the injection of BoNT is often linked to a serial casting. However, the data available so far on the benefits of this combination, as well as the single treatment with casting are insufficient. In a systematic review could be proven that casting of the wrist or elbow in patients after traumatic brain injury and post-stroke at least after removal of the cast results in an improvement in the range of motion 10. In a randomized controlled trial was one day after removal the elbow cast an improved compared to the control group in the range of motion. This difference was, however, in follow-up four weeks later no longer detectable 11. The extent to which the combination of BoNT injection and casting has an advantage over a single dose injection of BoNT, is also not sufficiently substantiated. Merely for the lower extremity are data that could show better passive mobility of the ankle joint after injection of BoNT plus casting compared to singel treatment with cast 12.<br/><br/>Apart from the basic question of the superiority of a combination of BoNT injection and casting also raises the question of their optimal time sequence. While Newman et al. (2007) 13 showed an advantage of delayed by four weeks Casting after injection of BoNT for spastic equinus in children, the working group to Wissel found in a pilot study (unpublished data) a better therapeutic effect in a BoNT injection 14 days after the start of the casting.<br/><br/>1.

We want to determine and evaluate some characteristics of the respiratory tract in this period. During mechanical ventilation the pulmonary alveoles often collapse in defined areas (atelectasis). This formation of atelectasis is even increased by elevated pressure in the thoracic. Exactly this happens in patients with side storage, single lung ventilation and patients with thoracic surgery. There are different ways to avoid the formation of atelectasis. Aim of the study is to improve the situation of artificially ventilated patients. Therefore we want to examine the influence of an elevated positive endexspiratory pressure (PEEP) on the patients lung-mechanics. Our main indicator for the condition of the patients lung will be the so called ""compliance"". It gives us information about the flexibility of the lung and constantly changes throughout a breath. There is an approximate value the compliance should have, indicating the most lung-protective setting of the PEEP. Our group has developed a method to measure the compliance during a breath that can be used during a surgery, giving advice on how to set the PEEP to the most lung-protective magnitude.<br/>We will be using this graphical user interface (GUI) on 90 patients, of which 45 will get active modulation of their PEEP-setting. They will be compared to the other 45 patients who will be ventilated with the commonly used PEEP. We are assuming that a higher PEEP-setting will have a positive influence on compliance and ventilation. Throughout the artificial ventilation we will also measure the effectiveness of the ventilation using another method developed by our group. For possible recruitment patients have to be adult and electice thoracic surgery";The analysis of respiratory mechanics during mechanical ventilation is more and more of scientific interest. The quality of ventilation is assessed via gas exchange, in particular via the peripheral oxygen saturation and the end-tidal CO2. There is evidence that an increased positive end-exspiratory pressure (PEEP) may prevent lung injury caused by mechanical ventilation and is supposed to decrease the formation of atelectasis. These patients have an enhanced risk of formation of atelectasis caused by increased intrathoracic pressure and the single lung ventilation : This group suffers intraoperatively from compression of lung tissue - caused by the pressure of the thoraces or single lung ventilation, respectively - resulting in decreased compliance of lung and thorax according to a restrictive ventilation disorder. Therefore we want to figure out how much the PEEP has to be increased to achieve a maximum in lung-protection. Thus, in one group of patients PEEP will be set according to the graphical user interface (GUI) our group has developed. It is using the gliding-SLICE-method, also developed by our group. Another group of patients will get the commonly used PEEP and will serve as a comparison. ;Recruiting complete, follow-up complete;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;http://www.drks.de//drks_web/navigate.do?navigationId=trial.HTML&TRIAL_ID=DRKS00010457;2019-08-22T07:14:45.934+02:00;;Freiburg;FALSE;

Most psychotherapies, however, do not adequately and/or effectively address suicidality, and specific interventions targeting suicidality (and related cognitive biases) are either not incorporated or neglected in existing cognitive-behavioral therapy manuals for depression. <br/>	Metacognitive training for depression (D-MCT) was designed to provide a low-threshold, standardized group training, which is presented to participants by using a computer slide presentation and is administered by a therapist. It builds upon current cognitive and neuropsychological theories and aims to challenge and alter depression-specific thinking styles and errors, which have been found to play an important role in the formation and maintenance of the disorder. So far, suicidality and suicide prevention is not explicitly addressed. Aim of the proposed study is to evauate safety, feasabilty and efficacy of two complementary MCT modules specifically addressing suicidality.  MCT will be implemented for a period of 4 weeks. Outcome assessments will be carried out shortly after admission, immediately after the intervention, and one month later. ;Aim of the current study is the evaluation of MCT modules for suicidality regarding feasibility, safety, and effectiveness in the treatment of pa-tients with depressive disorders in an open-label study. We expect a significant improvement of primary and secondary outcome parameters right after treatment as well as four weeks later (one month follow-up). The primary outcome will be defined as a change of suicidality assessed with the Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation (BSS). Secondary outcome parameters will be the change of depressive symptoms, as well as dysfunctional cognitions and metacognitive distortions related to suicidality assessed with the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Ruminative Responses Scale (RRS), Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS), Dysfunctional Attitude Scale (DAS), Metacognition Questionnaire (MCQ-30).;Recruiting complete, follow-up complete;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;http://www.drks.de//drks_web/navigate.do?navigationId=trial.HTML&TRIAL_ID=DRKS00010543;2020-05-18T10:38:03.900+02:00;;Hamburg;FALSE;

This procedure usually requires remodeling with cranial vault reconstruction. Vault craniotomies are typically performed with spiral craniotome cutters (Hilan) in combination with dura guards, whereas the osteotomy of the forehead area is performed by means of oscillating micro saws. Alternatively the osteotomy can be carried out by Piezosurgery, a new technique utilizing the microvibrations of scalpels at ultrasonic frequency. Ultrasonic tools have been reported to be of clinical usefulness in lowering the risk of surgical trauma to the adjacent tissues like dura and the soft tissue of the orbit. Aim of this study is to compare  the perceived surgical outcomes after use of piezosurgery devices as well as patient discomfort with those cases in which conventional osteotomy for cranioplasty had been done. Parameters of interest are surgery time, patient discomfort and possible complications.;Patients with craniosynostosis requires cranioplasty. The osteotomy should be rapid, precise and gentle. Aim of the prospective randomized study with two cohorts (piezosurgical versus standard surgical technique with oscillating saw and rotary cutter) is the comparison of this two different methods of osteotomy.

Parents are often in conflict about how they can prepare their children for a sensible and age appropriate use and where they should intervene. The prevention program MEDIA PROTECT (Bleckmann, Rehbein, Seidel & Mößle, 2014) informs about age-appropriate strategies for the prevention of problematic screen media use, it conveys parent’s competencies in dealing with screen media, thus strengthening families. The development was on basis of findings on the consequences of problematic screen media use and resource-oriented consulting work.<br/>With MEDIA PROTECT, we want to ensure that children between four to seven years of age don’t have their own screen devices in their bedroom and spend time with screen media as little as possible. In fact MEDIA PROTECT is willing to extend the scope of children in the real world and contributes strengthening a possible direct and trusting relationship between children and parents.<br/>The goal of the evaluation of MEDIA PROTECT is to investigate in the effectiveness of prevention of problematic screen media use. Children in the intervention group should spend less time watching screen media and own fewer screen media equipment in their bedrooms than in the control group.<br/>;"Screen media equipment in childrens’ bedroom and their daily, possibly dysfunctional use rises rapidly during the kindergarten and primary school time (Feierabend, Karg & Rathgeb, 2013; Mößle, 2012) and is associated with adverse effects on child development. More screen media equipment in their own bedroom is associated with longer screen time, which in turn is associated with a higher consumption of problematic content. Longitudinal studies describe that use routines have a high stability so that it is difficult to turn track switches at an advanced age (Hancox, Milne & Poulton, 2005; Mößle, 2012). Longitudinal studies report that children of lower socio-economic status are more affected by the negative impact than children with higher social status (Schmidt et al., 2012). This applies to all three sub categories of  problematic media use (equipment / time, content and functionality). <br/>""Whether a child grows up to an adult who is capable of electronic media and uses it dosed, active, creative and tech-savvy to enrich his life or be passive subject to the maelstrom loois central part of the media socialization in the family ""(Bleckmann, Seidel, Pfeiffer & Mößle, 2013).<br/>Therefore, the Criminological Research Institute of Lower Saxony developed the MEDIA PROTECT intervention (Bleckmann et al, 2014; Bleckmann et al, 2013.). It consists of three modules for three different target groups and includes a teachers training, an interactive stage play for children, a parents' evening and a voucher for a telephone consultation for parents on the subjects media consumption, media education, media addiction prevention, risk factors and protective mechanisms for Internet and video game addiction.<br/>The aim of the present study is to determine the effectiveness of the MEDIA PROTECT intervention with the target group ""parents"" of children between four to seven years of age to prevent problematic screen media use. The aim of the intervention is to reduce the screen times, media equipment in children's bedrooms and dysfunctional use. Children in the intervention group will spend less time with screen media, have less screen media in their bedroom and watch television less dysfunctional than children in the control group.

regulation of delayed onset muscle soreness;ARDOMS;[---]*;[---]*;The sympathetic part of the autonomic nervous system has particularly been associated to induce neurogenic inflammation via vasodilation and plasma extravasation and the release of pro-inflammatory neuropeptides from its own nerve fibers. This inflammation decreases the response threshold of nociceptors and simultaneously recruits quiescent or “silent” nociceptors from the neighborhood. Thus peripheral sensitization occurs, which reinforces the vicious circle even further. Tracey describes this process as an “inflammatory reflex of the autonomic nervous system,” reflexively adjusting the inflammatory and immune responses of the human body.<br/><br/>The blockade of the sympathetic nervous system might provide a preventive or rehabilitative approach to control the muscular nociceptive input in delayed-onset muscle soreness (DOMS). As DOMS is an acute painful state, a single blockade appears adequate to reduce the nociceptor activity. As we don’t know if the role of the sympathetic nervous system is active in both, the preventive and the rehabilitative setting, we chose to investigate both conditions. We assume the sympathetic nervous system to contribute to the decrease of the muscular pain threshold (as assessed by pressure pain threshold) following DOMS when compared to subjects with a stellate blockade.;Recruiting complete, follow-up complete;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;http://www.drks.de//drks_web/navigate.do?navigationId=trial.HTML&TRIAL_ID=DRKS00010623;2019-11-19T09:43:21.210+01:00;;Frankfurt;FALSE;

In some cases, the symptoms remain after the end of treatment. Until now, there are no curative treatment options for chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN).  Acupuncture treatment showed positive results on CIPN in a limited number of case studies based on subjective parameters. The aim of this study is to investigate if there are objective effects of acupuncture treatment on CIPN as measured by nerve conduction studies in a cross-over design with two treatment groups. In the first study period, the results of the primary treatment group are compared to a wait-list group, then the primary wait-list group receives acupuncture treatment and results are compared to the first group who remained without treatment during the second study period.;Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) involves damage to the peripheral nervous system and can produce severe neuropathic pain or gait impairment. CIPN may be a reason to terminate or suspend chemotherapy treatments. Specific and effective curative treatments are lacking. The major groups of drugs that induce CIPN include the taxanes, vinca alkaloids and platinum compounds. The incidence of CIPN is high and can reach levels of up to 92%. Publications in English language journals on acupuncture as a symptomatic treatment for CIPN have been limited to only a few case studies, all of which report an improvement in symptoms. The aim of this randomized non-blinded study was to determine whether there is objective evidence of effective treatment of CIPN with acupuncture as measured by nerve conduction studies compared to wait list patients in a cross-over design.;Recruiting complete, follow-up complete;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;http://www.drks.de//drks_web/navigate.do?navigationId=trial.HTML&TRIAL_ID=DRKS00010625;2016-06-23T17:13:47.951+02:00;;Hamburg;FALSE;

Examples include, for example, shift work, an increase of psychosocial stressors or own lifestyle. Contrary to go the easy way to bed is often still a minimum cognitive performance required. A common remedy is the intake of coffee or energy drinks. These are in high dimensions but little health. This study will investigate whether a morning physical activity unit is also adapted to compensate for periods of fatigue regarding cognitive performance.;"Lack of sleep and fatigue are common phenomena in our society. However, sleep is an important neurobiological size, which affects a substantial part of our ability to remember. During sleep, new impressions are processed in different neural networks and distributed to different areas of the brain to store. However, this process can lead to so-called false memories, because the information is incorporated into already existent networks of memory. This can lead to a, mixing 'of information the same subject come, so-called false memories. This natural phenomenon can now be reinforced by external factors such as stress or lack of sleep. Besides the loss of vigilance, attention or executive functions, sleepless nights lead to an increased probability of occurrence of false memories.<br/>Physical activity is considered healthy in many respects. In addition to improved energy metabolism in particular improvements in cardiovascular health but also cerebral play an important role.<br/>Certainly should sleep loss will most likely meet with sofa. In today's fast time, however, measures are needed which can shortly do us the necessary things of everyday life, before we can approve these recoveries. Regarding lack of sleep Consumption particular the administration of increased doses of caffeine, but other were ""energy drinks"" described. The number of students who use the so-called ""brain doping"" in order to improve their performance is constantly increasing. Investigations found that 12% of respondents in 2012 students in Germany had since the beginning of their studies used one or more substances to meet the demands of their studies can do justice. Five per cent of these students are taking a prescription medication, such as analgesics, tranquilizers or Psychostimulatoren. Another five percent again take so-called ""soft enhancer"": it is trying to improve services with the help of vitamins, homeopathic or herbal remedies or caffeine-containing products.<br/>At least to overcome a natural measure a lack of sleep for a short time would be the implementation of physical activity.<br/>This study is in an established model (Diekelmann et al. 2008 PLoS ONE 3 (10) e3512) and was designed to investigate if physical activity reduces the occurrence of false memories by sleep loss and improves concentration.";Recruiting complete, follow-up complete;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;http://www.drks.de//drks_web/navigate.do?navigationId=trial.HTML&TRIAL_ID=DRKS00010655;2019-11-20T13:54:30.388+01:00;;Frankfurt;FALSE;

Here, the natural, dense and opaque lens is removed and replaced by an intraocular lens, which is inserted into the eye. <br/>Within 5 years after surgery, approximately every fourth patient has a visual deterioration, caused by clouding of the posterior capsule.<br/>To prevent this, the posterior capsule can be removed during surgery manually or using a femtosecond laser.<br/>In this study, both eyes are operated in the conventional manner using ultrasound energy. Additionally, in one of both eyes, the posterior lens capsule is opened with the femtosecond laser.<br/>In doing so, formation of a secondary cataract (also: after-cataract or posterior capsule opacification, PCO) can be prevented. Thus, any further intervention for the patient would be avoided.<br/>Measuring retinal thickness and other parameters is necessary in order to investigate the safeness of the additional posterior capsule opening with the femtosecond laser during cataract surgery.<br/>Patients with a minimum age of 22 years are enrolled  in this study.<br/>;Posterior capsule opacification is still the most common long-term complication of cataract surgery. The so-called secondary cataract can lead to a significant impairment of vision, its treatment is usually carried out by a Nd: YAG capsulotomy, ie, an excision of the clouded posterior capsule by Nd: YAG laser at a special slit lamp: However, even this treatment option has possible side effects  as the anterior vitreous surface is affected. Retinal edema,  retinal detachment and elevation of intraocular pressure or  a damage or change in position of the intraocular lens is possible. Despite a number of  measures to avoid opacification such as the variation of surgical techniques and the development of intraocular lens designs,  formation of a secondary cataract is usually delayed, but  not entirely avoided. Another option is the removal of the posterior lens capsule intraoperatively, leaving the anterior vitreous surface intact.  However, this approach is manually demanding. Since 2009,  femtosecond laser systems have been in use to perform different steps of cataract surgery. The Catalys Precision Laser System (Abbott Medical Optics, Illinois, USA) allows a circular opening of the posterior capsule after implantation of intraocular lens without further intraocular manipulation. This femtosecond laser-assisted posterior capsulotomy is independent of manual skills.<br/>The safety of the femtosecond laser-assisted posterior capsulotomy will be investigated prospectively.  During  scheduled visits patients will be examined and measurements will be taken. The first 150 eyes treated showed no perioperative complications or side effects, however, a systematic analysis is necessary.<br/>;Recruiting complete, follow-up complete;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;http://www.drks.de//drks_web/navigate.do?navigationId=trial.HTML&TRIAL_ID=DRKS00010845;2016-08-03T10:59:10.719+02:00;;Bochum;FALSE;

The secondary objective is to measure the remaining astigmatism after Ankoris-implantation compared to the desired astigmatic correction. The Alpin's method is to analyze the refractive outcomes. This prospective, non-randomized, open study refers to 20 eyes of twenty healthy patients without preoperative Okularpathologie with a preoperative corneal cylinder 1-3 D. The biometric parameters of the patient require a spherical IOL power of 15 to 25D. This IOL is used according to the indications and according to the usual method of operation for toric cataracts using the same viscoelastic (OVD) (integral, Physiol) and of the same injector (Accuject 2.2 mm) is used, so that distortions may be excluded. Each eye is examined after 1 day, 1 month and 3 months. In addition to the evaluation of the optical and refractive results Photos of slit lamp examination are required.

As a result, they often develop posttraumatic stress symptoms such as re-experiencing, avoidance, negative cognitions/emotions, concentration or sleep disturbances. Due to the fact that the child welfare system is in a state of congestion as well as language and cultural barriers, they do not have access to an adequate psychotherapeutic intervention. UYR are under pedagogic care of the German child welfare system. Our work group developed a trauma-pedagogic group intervention in the child welfare setting, which shall be evaluated in its effectiveness, regarding symptom reduction, through this study. For this purpose, social workers who implement the intervention are trained and regularly supervised by experienced clinicians. After a promising pilot phase, this study aims at evaluating the intervention’s effectiveness when put into comparison with a group that is excluded from the intervention and therefore only receives the regular pedagogical care.;Unaccompanied young refugees often report several traumatic events and hence develop posttraumatic stress and depressive symptoms. Within the scope of this project a manualized trauma-pedagogic group intervention in child welfare institutions will be evaluated in an RCT-design, regarding the symptom reduction. The results of the intervention group will be compared to a group that solely receives the regular pedagogical care of the child welfare system.;Recruiting complete, follow-up complete;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;http://www.drks.de//drks_web/navigate.do?navigationId=trial.HTML&TRIAL_ID=DRKS00010915;2019-11-13T07:53:37.481+01:00;;Ulm;FALSE;

As a result of cardio-vascular disease, arrhythmogenic disfunction and Cor pulmonale the morbidity and mortality of patients with COPD is increased. Further restrictive co-morbidities are systemic inflammation, weight loss, loss of lean body mass, sceletal muscle dysfunction, ostoeporosis, depression and anxiety disorders. A serious chronic lung condition such as COPD and accompanied by considerable co-morbidities requires a comprehensive monitoring of specific parameters in patients who are at risk in order to detect a deterioration in their condition early on before medical emergency treatment is required. The WELCOME Weste is supposed to guarantee the continuous monitoring of specific parameters for the purpose of gaining a timely impression of the patient's state of health and its evaluation from a medical point of view.

In this relapse situation, psychological factors relevant for compliance, such as individual beliefs and action plans, are identified on the aforementioned 12 wards and analysed in terms of strengths and weaknesses on six of the wards. In 2013, on these six wards feedback discussions with ward managers and educational sessions for physicians and nurses are tailored with regard to the wards' strengths and weaknesses, and implemented. On the other six wards, the standard ASH-campaign is implemented. It is assumed that the tailored interventions would lead to higher and more sustainable rebounds in hand hygiene compliance. ";"Hand hygiene (HH) is considered to be the most effective measure to prevent nosocomial infections (NI). At the same time, surveillance data show that even on intensive care units (ICU), which are affected by the highest NI-rates (prevalence in Germany: 19%, at Hannover Medical School [MHH]: 28%), compliance is suboptimal. Also, there is a lack of knowledge on how to deal with relapses such as those experienced on the 10 ICU and two hematopoietic stem cell transplantation units at MHH after initial successes of the German ""Clean Care is Safer Care""-campaign (ASH). The PSYGIENE-study, funded by the German Federal Ministry of Health (project-ID: INFEKT-019), analyses whether interventions tailored to wards based on the Health Action Process Approach (HAPA) lead to (more) sustainable rebounds of hand hygiene compliance. In a cluster-randomized controlled trial, problem-focused interviews with responsible ward physicians and head nurses and a written questionnaire survey are conducted and, on the basis of these HAPA-data, education sessions for physicians and nurses and feedback discussions with ward managers tailored to and implemented on six of the aforementioned wards.

They increase the core body temperature and show an effect on the circadian rhythm of hormons and the sleep quality. The hypothesis of this study is that sequentially applied HTB will be superior to an other established treatment for patients with middle graded depression (sequential sport therapy). Furthermore, the tolerance of this treatment and the handling in an ambulant setting should be lined out. Each participant receives 16 applications over 8 weeks, which means two per week. The first 4 applications will take place under guidance of two medical postgraduates, the follwing 12 applications are to be carried out at home and documented by the patients themselves. <br/>Included in the study will be male and female participants aged 18 to 65 with diagnosis of depression since at least 4 weeks. The depression should be middle-graded. The severity will be assessed by an standardized questionnaire (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale 17) and should show an index of at least 18 points. ;Patients with a depression, measured by Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, receive randomized 16 HTB or 16 sessions of sport therapy during 8 weeks. The first 4 applications will take place under guidance of two medical postgraduates, who will also do the measuring (infrared ear thermometer) bevfore and after the bath and after the rest time. Furthermore, water temperature as well as actual duration of bath and rest time will be documented. <br/>The follwing 12 applications are to be carried out at home and the parameters mentioned above will be documented by the patients themselves on prepared questionnaires.<br/>Also in the sport group body temperature will be measured before and after intervention as well as duration of training and number of exercises.<br/>Primary outcome is the HAMD-17 score (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale) after 2 weeks of intervention (4 applications). The survey will take place directly before the 5. intervention in order to include the effects of the 4. intervention.<br/>Secondary outcome is HAMD-17 score after 8 weeks of treatment, Becks Depression Inventary (BDI) and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) after 2 and 8 weeks of treatment as well as indices of tolerance and practicability in an ambulant setting. <br/><br/>Corresponding to the estimated effect strenght from a former pilot study, 40 patients (20 per group) are planned as case number for this study.;Recruiting complete, follow-up complete;trial protocol (mandatory for transfer to Studybox);179c2375-91fc-4325-92d8-336250cd20e2;Prüfprotokoll0416 Sportmessung.doc;Prüfprotokoll;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;http://www.drks.de//drks_web/navigate.do?navigationId=trial.HTML&TRIAL_ID=DRKS00011013;2018-08-13T13:58:26.855+02:00;;Freiburg;FALSE;

Additionally, a medication can be applied on the residual caries. In this study, however, the application of Biodentine, a new, bioactive cement, which was launched by Septodont, and its additional effect in sealing remaining caries is determined.   <br/>In each Patient, participating in the study, two teeth with carious lesions of quite similiar extension will be treated in a first visit with removal parts of the carious biomass gathering caries samples for further analyzes. In one of the teeth, the residual caries will be sealed with Biodentine. Both teeth will be restored  with a proper composite filling thus protecting them against bacteria. Eight weeks later, a reentry will be performed in which samples of the remaining caries will gathered. Samples will be analyzed by scientific test methods. The effect of Biodentine on the residual caries is investigated. Furthermore, additional information about the bacteria which are involved in the development of caries are obtained.;Especially in deep primary carious dentine lesions without symptoms and maintained vitality it could be advantageous to leave carious mass in proximity of the pulp for safety reasons and keeping the tooth vital. Many aspects have to be considered in this context. A very important question is how much caries can be left and what is the best treatment strategy in cases of partial caries removal (sealing of the remaining carious mass or no sealing, sealing with special antibacterial adhesives). It might be reasonably assumed that the microbial flora is crucial to the toxin load to the pulpal tissues, deciding about post-operative pulpal symptoms as well as caries progression by degradation of the interfacial bond and demineralization of the tooth. <br/>Biodentine is calcium silicate-based cement which was launched by Septodont and was developed for the treatment of deep or large carious lesions as well as pulp capping for keeping pulp vitality. <br/>Primarily, this study aims at determining the antibacterial effect of Biodentine in residual caries after partial caries removal. For comparison with a control group, at a second tooth with a carious lesion of comparable extension, residual caries is covered with guttapercha. Both teeth are restored with a proper adhesive composite restoration after application of Biodentine or guttapercha at the residual caries, respectively. After eight weeks, reentry is performed and sample material of the residual caries is obtained from both teeth at each study patient. Secondary outcome is the determination of microbial composition in deep carious lesions before and after partial caries removal and application of different therapy strategies. All samples are analyzed by cultural methods and culture-independent methods (PCR) considering presence of bacteria and bacterial DNA. Samples positively tested for 16S rRNA genes were analyzed using terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP, a fingerprinting method based on PCR) regarding their bacterial composition. <br/>Patients with two teeth with carious lesions of comparable extension are included into the study (randomized application of Biodentine and guttapercha). <br/>Besides the microbial analyses, additional conventional and fluorescence aided imaging techniques are applied during the study course.<br/>;Recruiting complete, follow-up complete;Abstract;[---]*;https://www.karger.com/Article/Abstract/488302;Abstract für das Poster zur Jahrestagung der ORCA 2018 (Nummer 48);Paper;[---]*;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jdent.2019.103264;Effect of a bioactive cement on the microbial community in carious dentin after selective caries removal - an in-vivo study;;;;;;;;;;;;;http://www.drks.de//drks_web/navigate.do?navigationId=trial.HTML&TRIAL_ID=DRKS00011067;2020-01-07T07:26:50.545+01:00;;Leipzig;FALSE;

The Treatment started on the day of the first visit (E1), the next day (E2), after one week (E3) and a recall was done after one (E4) and three (E5) months. On each examination day the clinical parameters bleeding on probing (BoP), pus, modified plaque index, pocket depth (PD), and crevicular fluid have been checked. Microbiological tests, screening the periodontal pathogens at the implant site and the matrix metalloproteinase were done on E1, E3 and E5.<br/>Results: A considerable decrease in BoP could be seen in patients of group I and II, of PI in all patients with the largest positive effect in group III. Comparing the efficacy of the non-surgical therapies no difference could be seen in any of the parameters. <br/>Conclusions: Some clinical signs of the peri-implantitis improved after the use of aPDT and CHX. Whereas, it was neither possible to reduce PD nor to see any benefit of the non-surgical therapy after a follow up of three months. The use of aPDT and CHX did have complementary effects and those treatments could be used as preliminary step before surgical treatment of the peri-implantitis.<br/>";Recruiting complete, follow-up complete;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;http://www.drks.de//drks_web/navigate.do?navigationId=trial.HTML&TRIAL_ID=DRKS00011171;2017-03-13T15:21:57.885+01:00;;Mainz;FALSE;

One hypothesis is that a high proportion of the fatty acid linoleic acid inhibits this conversion. Therefore, the present study aims to investigate in healthy male volunteers, what is the conversion rate with daily administration of linseed oil under a diet which is either rich in linoleic rich or poor in linoleic acid.<br/>Long-chain omega-3 fatty acids also show numerous health-promoting effects. The molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of these fatty acids are only partially known. Many of the effects trace back to oxidized metabolites of these fatty acids, so-called oxylipins. Therefore, the oxylipin profile of the participants will be examined with respect to the intervention.;Long-chain omega-3 fatty acids (LC n-3 PUFA) show numerous health-promoting effects. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of LC n-3 PUFA are only partially known. It has been shown that many physiological effects of LC n-3 PUFA trace back to their oxidized metabolites (oxylipins) involved as lipid mediators in a variety of biological processes such as inflammation, pain and blood clotting. Apart from the formation by non-enzymatic autoxidation oxylipins are depending on the substrate, formed especially by enzymatic conversion. LC n-3 PUFA such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) compete with arachidonic acid (AA) for the same enzymes to form oxylipins, whereby LC n-3 PUFA, for example, modulate the immune response and inflammation. On the one hand, the formation of pro-inflammatory effective AA oxylipins is inhibited, on the other hand some EPA and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) -Oxylipine are directly anti-inflammatory.<br/>The precursor fatty acid alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) can be transformed via a multi-step enzymatic elongation and desaturation process in EPA and DHA. However, the conversion process is very inefficient. A high proportion of LA in the diet additionally inhibits the conversion of ALA to EPA and DHA fatty acids as both compete for the same enzymes. In the present intervention study the metabolism of LC PUFA and its oxylipins in a two-week linseed (ALA-rich) -supplementation will be examined under LA-poor and LA-rich diet in metabolically healthy male volunteers.;Recruiting complete, follow-up complete;Paper;[---]*;[---]*;Greupner T, Kutzner L, Pagenkopf S, Kohrs H, Hahn A, Schebb NH, Schuchardt JP (2018): Effects of a low and a high dietary LA/ALA ratio on long-chain PUFA concentrations in red blood cells.

The electrical isolation of the pulmonary veins is an established and frequently used therapy option for the treatment of symptomatic, refractory pre-fibrillation. Via the veins of the groin the heart is reached with the catheters. To place the catheters in the area of ​​the pulmonary veins, it is necessary to puncture the wall between the two atria so that the catheters can be inserted into the left atrium. At the junction of the pulmonary veins into the left atrium, the release of cold (cryo-energy) or heat (radiofrequency energy) occurs. The aim is to electrically isolate the pulmonary veins from the atrium so that no interfering potentials from the pulmonary veins can bring the cardiac rhythm out of the rhythm. The lung with its bronchial system is also in close proximity to the pulmonary veins. After a cryo-ablation, coughing and blood shedding are described in the literature.

The perioperative morbidity and mortality after caesarean section has decreased but is still associated with high levels of postoperative pain. In an analysis of postoperative pain scores of more than 70.000 patients in Germany the caesarean section belongs to the most painful surgical procedures. The intensity of postoperative pain may interfere with the ability of breastfeeding and ambulation, the incidence of postpartal depression and of chronic postoperative pain. Patients after caesarean section often receive less analgesics than patients after comparable operation due to the fear of a negative effect on the breastfed newborn.<br/>Oxycodone is an established opioid for the treatment of postoperative pain. As an opioid it is transferred into the breast milk but an influence on the breastfed newborn is unlikely since studies have shown that even after maternal intake of high doses of oxycodone only in one of fifty breastfed newborns oxycodone could be detected in clinical irrelevant concentrations. Thus oxycodone might be an option to treat postoperative pain after caesarean section. The goal of the study is to investigate the effect of oxycodone and ibuprofen in a fixed dosing scheme compared to the prior in our institution established post operative pain therapy with ibuprofen, paracetamol and opioids only on demand.<br/><br/><br/>;"The rate of caesarean sections (CS) is increasing and has reached about one third of all deliveries worldwide. The activation of the coagulation system during pregnancy and the following risk of thrombosis is one reason for the importance of an adequate postoperative pain therapy after CS to warrant early mobilisation. Another reason is the fact that postoperative pain after CS interferes with the ability of nursing and caretaking for the newborn (1, 2). The choice of analgesics has to consider the transfer of drugs into the breast milk and possible negative effects on the breastfed newborn. An analysis of a large database of postoperative pain therapy in Germany showed that CS belongs to the surgical procedures with the highest postoperative pain (3) scores but the intensity of postoperative pain after CS is often under estimated (4). In several intuitions the dosage of opioids is restricted to 10 mg morphine (5) although the opioid-doses that were required under study-condition to achieve adequate pain levels are about 6-fold higher (4, 6). Thus an analgesic under-treatment of postoperative pain after CS is likely. Oral opioids for postoperative pain after CS seems to be as effective as an intravenous patient controlled analgesia and may be associated with less side effects (7).  <br/>Sustained release oxycodone is known as an effective opioid for postoperative analgesia. As other opioids oxycodone is concentrated in the human breast milk. Due to the small amount of ingested breast milk, a clinical relevant uptake of oxydone  by the newborn is unlikely. Even high doses of oxycodone in childbed (up to 90 mg/day) yielded to no clinical relevant oxycodone plasma levels in breastfed newborns (8). <br/>The combination of opioids and NSAID for postoperative pain therapy after CS is reasonable, because the use of NSAID is associated with a reduced opioid dose (9-11). Ibuprofen is the most common NSAID for postoperative pain therapy after CS (5) and a oral dose 1600 mg/die as effective as 4x 1 g paracetamol i.v. (12). Ibuprofen is not secreted in human breast milk (milk/plama coefficient 0,008). Thus an influence on the newborn by this medication is excluded.<br/>The goal of this investigation is to document the status of postoperative pain therapy after CS in our institution and to investigate the effectivity of a systemic oral pain therapy after CS on the base of oxycodone and ibuprofen and if there is an association between postoperative pain and fear, stress and depression in early childbed. <br/><br/>1.

Treatment modalities of pain patients are discussed diversely. Single standing therapeutic measures are considered less efficient and with less impact than multimodal approaches.

The increased ventilation causes a hypoxia-induced respiratory alkalosis. The respiratory alkalosis is regulated with a renal compensation and a loss of bicarbonate. A reduced blood bicarbonate level correlates with a reduced blood buffer capacity and, regarding anaerobic exercise, a reduced blood buffer capacity leads to a decreased exercise performance. So, the main aim of the study is to evaluate whether an alkalizing or acidizing diet can affect anaerobic exercise performance under normobaric hypoxic conditions positively. <br/>The results of this study can probably contribute to nutritional recommendations for aloine climbers, mountaineers and athletes training under hypoxic conditions.;Recruiting complete, follow-up complete;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;http://www.drks.de//drks_web/navigate.do?navigationId=trial.HTML&TRIAL_ID=DRKS00011500;2019-12-08T16:46:04.794+01:00;;Bochum;FALSE;

In case of severe asthma (GINA 5) Bronchial Thermoplasty (BT) is a relatively new bronchoscopic therapy. Radiofrequency, delivered with a dedicated catheter-processor-unit (ALAIR) leads to heat induced apoptosis of airmac smooth muscles, that is followed by declination of remodeling. Randomized-controlled study has shown it's feasibility, safety and also the positive effects on quality of life and disease control.  <br/>Recently published studies show additional effects of BT on bronchial structures, also in the middle lobe bronchus, which is usually not treated. <br/>We assume additional effects, e.g. denervation of parabronchial nerval structures. <br/><br/>We want to investigate this theory by a modified treatment schedule. BT is performed in 3 sessions. 1st session will a sonographic measurement of bronchial wall structures with radial EBUS and biopsy, which is followed by BT of the right lower lobe, the intermediate bronchus, the middle lobe and right main bronchus as well as left main bronchus. 2nd session after 4 weeks will include the left lower lobe. 3rd session after another 4 weeks will repeat EBUS and biopsy and finish BT by treatment of both the upper lobes. <br/>Periprocedural medication to prevent asthma worsening includes orale prednisone.

This is intended to enable the patient to improve vision in the inter- and close-up area and to avoid the use of spectacles in comparison to conventional intraocular lenses.<br/>The study lens is implanted only in one eye. The other eye receives a proven conventional aspheric IOL. Your investigator decides which eye the study lens is used in to achieve an optimal effect.<br/>Before the implantation of the test product, the Patient will be examined by the investigator to determine whether he is eligible for participation in the study. This examination is a review of the general health and the eyes, including the history of the disease and, where appropriate, the medicinal products taken. If the inclusion criteria for the study are met, a date for the operations is defined.<br/>Patients are asked to come to the examination the day after surgery and a week later. Afterwards, the patients are asked to undergo a re-examination 1, 3 and 6 months after implantation. A standard examination of the eye is carried out at every scheduled date, which largely corresponds to the examination before the start of the study. Each examination session can take between 45 and 90 minutes. All examinations follow the standard examinations after cataract surgery and are painless. For some examinations, the pupil is enlarged so that the physician can view the posterior areas of the eye.<br/>In addition, patients are asked to complete a questionnaire to your satisfaction with your vision.<br/>In some patients the facial field, the contrast sensitivity and / or the centering of the study lens are also measured. These examinations are also painless.<br/>Patients of both sexes and with a minimum age of 18 years are included in the study;In this multicentric study, the clinical acceptance of the intraocular lens (IOL) IC-8 from Acufocus is to be investigated.<br/>The IC-8 IOL is a sterile, single-use, single piece hydrophobic IOL with a centrally located,<br/>embedded polyvinylidene di-fluoride (PVDF) mask intended to improve far vision as well as<br/>intermediate and near vision by extending the depth of focus based on the concept of smallaperture<br/>optics. The 6 mm diameter optic is an aspheric biconvex shape and is UV-blocking.<br/>The IC-8 IOL’s overall diameter, including haptics, is 12.5 mm. The IC-8 IOL is available in<br/>powers ranging from +20* to +27 diopters in 0.5 diopter steps.<br/>This lens offers an enlarged depth-of-Focus range according to the principle of a pinhole. This is intended to enable the patient - in comparison to conventional intraocular lenses - to improve vision in the inter- and close-up range and to avoid a large number of spectacles.<br/>Approximately 130 patients will be included in the study and re-examined over a period of 6 months. The study lens is implanted only in one eye, the other eye is given a conventional monofocal IOL. By combining the lens with the aperture and a normal lens, the patient should have good vision in all distance areas.<br/>After checking the suitability of the patient, the eye is routinely measured to select the correct IOL strength. The doctor also determines the dominant eye of the patient and implanted the IC-8 study lens into the non-dominant eye. In postoperative examinations, the visual acuity is measured with and without correction in the distance, near and in the intermediate range.<br/>Patients are asked to complete a questionnaire to their satisfaction with their vision.<br/>As a study hypothesis, study lens is thought to provide an acceptable depth of sharpness measured as acceptable vision in the distance, near and intermediate range.<br/>;Recruiting complete, follow-up complete;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;http://www.drks.de//drks_web/navigate.do?navigationId=trial.HTML&TRIAL_ID=DRKS00011600;2017-01-25T08:21:37.766+01:00;;Bochum;FALSE;

The functional impairement of the lungs might show regional differences. The established pulmonary lung function tests cannot detect the regional differences in the ventilation distribution. The new radiation-free imaging modality: electrical impedance tomography could reveal regional changes in lung function. The aim of the study is the determination of the regional lung function in parallel with the conventional pulmonary function testing during quiet tidal and deep forced breathing, before and after exercise challenge and after inhalative administration of a bronchodilator in children with asthma. In addition, the determination of the regional lung function in lung-healthy children should be carried out before and after exercise challenge in order to colect the reference values.   ;Despite the development of new diagnostic procedures, the diagnosis of bronchial asthma, as well as the subsequent therapy and the follow-up control, is still based on the conventional pulmonary function testing using the spirometry and the whole body plethysmography. In order to increase the significance of the pulmonary function testing, a bronchial provocation test is carried out to determine the bronchial hyperregibility and its reversibilty by bronchodilation test. In children, the provocation test is often carried out by an exercise challenge and short-acting beta-2-mimetics are used for bronchodilation. The application of spirometry and whole body plethysmography is associated with a known limitation: from globally determined parameters conclusions are drawn which relate to the whole lungs. Lots of pulmonary diseases, including bronchial asthma affect morphologically or / and functionally the lung tissue regional inhomogenously. Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) has the potential to be used in the future to determinate the regional lung function. This imaging modality is non-invasive and radiation-free. Because of the measuring principle, based on the determination of electrical properties of biologigal tissues measured on the body surface, it can also be used in children without any problems. Since the method has never been used in children with asthma, we would first like to use EIT  accompanying to clinically indicated pulmonary function testing during tidal breathing and forced vital capacity maneuvre. Then we would like to characterize the degree of the ventilation heterogeneity by new developped regional EIT parameters. Additionally we will also examine lung-healthy children in order to evaluate reference data for regional lung function. In asthma patients, the examinations will be carried out before and after exercise challenge and after bronchodilation test, in lung-healthy subjects just before and after exercise challenge. The long-term goal is to establish the EIT in pneumology as a method for the diagnosis, phenotyping and therapy control in pastients with bronchial asthma.;Recruiting complete, follow-up complete;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;http://www.drks.de//drks_web/navigate.do?navigationId=trial.HTML&TRIAL_ID=DRKS00011644;2017-04-06T08:37:08.024+02:00;;Kiel LÃ¼beck;FALSE;

The ultimate goal of radiomics is the development of novel prognostic models in neurooncology by adding quantitative data and machine-learning approaches to conventional qualitative image analysis.

The most common group of 20 to 45% of snorers are men in medium and high age. Snoring is often induced through the flagging of the soft palate and the resulting vibration of the soft tissue in the upper airways. The flagging leads to a restriction of the upper airways and a higher potential of vibration of the soft tissue. Thereby snoring is formed.<br/><br/>The aim of this study is therefore to examine how two logopedic therapies with different training units alter the snoring of male participants. The participants have to suffer from primary snoring induced by the soft palate.<br/>;The aim of this study is to compare the effectiveness of a speech and language therapeutic intervention using myofunctional exercises focusing on the invigoration of the velum and another one using myofunctional exercises that do not train the velum explicitly to improve the snoring of men suffering from primary snoring produced by the velum. First of all the positive votum of the ethics committee for this study was received on 31 of august 2016. Afterwards approximately ten subjects are recruited using inclusion- and exclusion criteria. Subjects can be included, if they are male and if they suffer from velar induced snoring. Apart from that they should have a stabile bodyweight and they should sign an informed consent. Subjects included in the study must not suffer from neurological illnesses, diabetes mellitus, dependencies, adiposity or from obstructive sleep apnea. Additionally there are no subjects included whose snoring is produced by another organ than the velum. To check the inclusion and exclusion criteria and to enable a pre- and post-therapy-comparison different diagnostic procedures are used. These diagnostic procedures include an ear nose and throat medical investigation, an anamnesis and two questionnaires concerning the daytime sleepiness and the sleepquality. To allow the comparison of objective parameters before and after the therapy and to make sure that the snoring actually is produced by the velum, which can be read in the frequency of the snoring, the SleepyLab is used. In this case only the sound plugin is needed to record the subjects’ snoring. After recording the subjects for at least one night the snoring frequency and the snoring amplitude are analysed using the sound analysis program Praat. Subsequent to the pretest the subjects are randomly devided into two groups. The first group receives the speech and language therapeutic intervention focusing on the velum. The other one gets the speech and language therapeutic intervention which does not train the velum explicitly. The therapy takes place once a week for 45 minutes during a period of eight weeks. Additionally the subjects do exercises at home on five days weekly. Afterwards the questions from the anamnesis are asked again and the questionnaires are filled in again in the post-test. Additionally the sleep diagnostics using the SleepyLap is repeated. Finally the results from pre- and post-test are compared for each subject and a statistical analysis is executed to compare the results of the two groups. <br/>;Recruiting complete, follow-up complete;Approval of ethics comm.

It is suspected that the taste of a drug can influence its perceived effectiveness against pain. In this experiment we test whether a putative painkiller works better if tasting bitter.<br/>We investigate this question in 138 healthy participants. To induce pain, participants are asked to submerge one hand into a cold water-bath while constantly rating the pain intensity on a scale. This procedure is performed before and after a treatment: participants are given drops of distilled water or distilled water+quinine (a bitter tasting agent), depending on the experimental group. During a waiting period the temperature of the cold water-bath is covertly increased to simulate treatment success. We will compare differences in the pain-rating curve (before vs after) between groups.<br/><br/>After study completion, data analysis indicated insufficient statistical power to allow reliable conclusions. This was due to the fact that the placebo effects observed in our study (d=0.27) were much smaller than assumend in the a-priori power-analysis (d=1.00).<br/><br/>Therefore, two post-hoc experiments were performed to increase the sample size and scope of the study:<br/><br/>In a second sub-study the original sample was extended by 30 more participants Probanden (10 participants per group). The sample size for this addition was chosen based on the available ressources for research.<br/><br/>In a third sub-study, we extended the sample by 150 participants, and extended the study scope by adding an experimental condition. We included a sweet tasting placebo condition to explore whether taste effects on placebo efficacy are driven by reward/aversion related mechanisms. The sample size of sub-study 3 was chosen on the the available ressources for research.;"This randomized, double-blind, between-group study with 138 healthy participants (male:female-ratio, 1:1) is conducted to test whether a putative analgesic drug effect can increases with bitter taste. For pain induction, participants are asked to immerse their hand in a 6°C water-basin, according to the cold-pressor test (CPT) protocol. Participants are free to withdraw their hand at any time. Pain ratings are recorded continuously and summarized over time as the area under the curve (primary outcome). <br/>After a baseline CPT, participants are given one of two inert treatments according to group allocation: dest. (control group) or a 0.03% Quinine-solution (test group), sublingually. The CPT is repeated with a covertly increased temperature (8°C) in order to simulate a subtle treatment effect. Outcomes are assessed using the general linear model, testing for interaction effects of the within-subject factor „time“ and the between-subject factor ""taste"". Our main hypothesis is that the taste of the placebo affects CPT pain ratings (area under the curve) in a pre- versus post-treatment comparison.<br/><br/>After study completion, data analysis indicated insufficient statistical power to allow reliable conclusions.

Previous studies suggest that such thrombosis may already develop during surgery. Patients to be operated on intracranial pathology are randomized into two groups: In one Group, standrad thromboprophylaxis (compression stockings and anti-thrombosis injections) are used. In the other group, multi-chambered sleeves are administered during surgery, which are intermittently inflated (Intermittend Pneumatic compression or IPC) in order so simulate the normal bloodflow of the legs. Primarily, the study scrutinizes the potential of IPC to reduce the risk of deep venuous thrombosis. Secondarily, the potential of certain laboratory parameters in the blood to detect thrombosis which has developed despite IPC is analyzed. ;Primary goal of the study is risk reduction attributable to Intermittent Pneumatic Compression (IPC) of the lower extremity during surgery for intracranial pathology in a randomized, prospective and blinded study. With respect to our previous study, patients operated on intracranial pathology have a higher threshold for D-dimers, the Transgression of which will predict/exclude venuous thromboembolism with a specificity of 74.1% and a sensitivity of 95.3% (Prell et al., 2012). With intraoperative administration of IPC, this threshold might be changed, and the definition of this new threshold is a secondary goal of the study. In addition, duration of surgery is assessed for all patients, as it has been shown to influence the risk of thrombosis. <br/><br/>Hypothesis 1: Intraoperative IPC reduces the incidence of venuous thromboembolism in patients operated on intracranial pathology. <br/>Hypothesis 2: There existes a threshold of D-dimers for the prediction/exclusion of venuous thromboembolism in patients with IPC-Administration during surgery for intracranial pathology, and it differs from the normal population and from a population operated on without IPC-administration. <br/>Hypothesis 3: Subgroups of patients in which IPC may be especially helpful can be identified by statistical analysis of clinical variables.;Recruiting complete, follow-up complete;Approval of ethics comm.

Unphysiological gait patterns lead to unnatural loading of muscles and joints and can cause pain and further gait disability in the medium and long term. In sport and rehabilitation, verbal feedback about the unnatural gait is applied by therapists or trainers. In this study we employ a technical, mobile feedback system to feed back deviations from a physiological gait pattern to patients with gait disabilities in order to give them the opportunity to actively normalize this pattern. The results of this study are used to verify if this method is feasible as an improved gait therapy. Participants with gait disabilities with incomplete spinal cord injury, stroke, Parkinson's disease and elderly (>65 years) are included.;Aim of this study is to test the feasibility of inertial sensor-based real-time feedback (FB) therapy in individuals with unphysiological gait pattern due to incomplete spinal cord injury (iSCI), stroke and conditions related to old age.<br/>In a bi-centric proof-of-concept study, individuals with unphysiological gait pattern train one pre-chosen gait parameter (stride length, stance or wing time, or angle between foot and ground at heel strike) using automated verbalized FB generated by a shoe mounted sensor system and a tablet PC. The training phase consists of 3 consecutive training visits and 1 follow-up visit 4 weeks post training. Training visits start with an initial gait analysis (iGA) with FB turned off, followed by 5 FB training runs of 2-3 min and end with another gait analysis. A parameter and individual independent level structure servs as evaluation criterion for the distance of the parameter to a physiological reference as well as for automated adaptation of training difficulty. Main outcome parameter is the mean level at iGA of visits 1 through 3.

If there is an indication for reduction but not osteosynthesis, the patient remains in the study if the stability allows ultrasound examination without a cast, otherwise the patient drops out.<br/>For all patients remaining in the study the mentioned variables are noted.<br/><br/>- if the US imaging reveals a fracture, a cast is applied<br/>- if the US revelas no fracture and at least one variable is positive, a suspect of a fracture is diagnosed and a cast applied<br/>- if the US reveals no fracture and no varaible is positive, a functional treatment is indicated<br/><br/>All patients are re-evaluated after 5 days and the mentioned variables are noted (including the patients with fx diagnosis!). No US examination is performed at this point, because there are no different findings expected. For all patients without a proved fractures diagnosis and no positive variables a functional treatment is indicated at this time. If there is at least one positive variable, x-rays in 2 directions are taken and the result is noted (this is our “safety-belt” for the fractures which might be missed by the initial ultrasound.).<br/><br/>All patients are reevaluated after 3 months by phone contact or physical examination.<br/><br/>When the study is completed we will extract the relevant variables for a safe diagnosis and treatment of the forarme fractures of children.<br/><br/>Patients to be enrolled:<br/>- children 12 years of age with clinical suspect of forearm fracture<br/>- patient is able to localize the pain verbally or by pointing with finger<br/>- informed consent with parents<br/><br/>Patients excluded:<br/>- fx with relevant soft-tissue wound<br/>- neurological or vascular lesion, compartment syndrome<br/>- fx which definitely demands reduction after clinical examination<br/>- lacking compliance<br/>- genetic disorder (i.e. osteogenesis imperfect, achondroplasia)<br/>- other lesions of hand, elbow which demand radiology<br/>- fractures a same location within last 24 months<br/><br/>Design:<br/>Prospective international multicentric phase IV diagnostic trial <br/><br/>Positive ethic statement from the ethic commission of the Ruhr-Universität Bochum<br/><br/>500 patients<br/>5 hospitals<br/>";Recruiting complete, follow-up complete;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;http://www.drks.de//drks_web/navigate.do?navigationId=trial.HTML&TRIAL_ID=DRKS00011936;2019-02-05T06:37:26.455+01:00;;Bochum;FALSE;

Also, consumption of acidic beverages increases so that the teeth are increasingly exposed to challenging conditions. The CANDIDA Toothpaste and Mouthwash with Curolox ™ Peptide (cosmetic products) are the latest developments of Mibelle ag, which are used to protect teeth. The Curolox ™ peptide supports the remineralisation of the teeth on one side and protects the teeth from demineralization on the other side.<br/>The aim of the study is to detect the protective effect of the peptide under natural conditions in the oral cavity.<br/>The study is carried out with volunteers who are ready to wear a dental specimen holder with human enamel plates in the lower jaw for 3 days. The sample holder should only be removed from the oral cavity during eating and brushing.<br/>The study is constructed as a monocentric, controlled, randomized in situ study. The three randomized groups are as follows:<br/>1) Candida toothpaste and mouthwash with peptide,<br/>2) Candida toothpaste with peptide and mouthwash without peptide,<br/>3) Toothpaste and mouthwash without peptide.;The oligopeptide-104 can provide protection against acid attack on the human tooth fuse. This technology of the so-called self-assembling peptides is known under the term Curolox ™ and is already successfully applied in the professional dental care for the regeneration of the molten tooth. There is currently no study on the protective effect of this preparation on human tooth fusion under natural oral conditions in the literature. To demonstrate this protective mechanism of the peptide, the present study was designed and implemented. In a monocentric, single-blind, placebo-controlled and randomized in-situ study, the protective effect of the peptide against acid attack on untreated human tooth surfaces should be demonstrated. For this purpose, a 33ppm oligopeptide 104-containing toothpaste, the Candida Professional Protect, was tested in single application as well as in combination with a 7ppm oligopeptide-104-containing mouthwash.<br/>The main focus of the study is to show that the Curolox technology, inserted into a commercially available toothpaste formulation, can have a protective effect on human tooth fusion with regard to acid attacks by acidic foods.;Recruiting complete, follow-up complete;Abstract;55dc2617-6d0c-4367-81e1-fc8abf306381;Abstract DGKFO Bremen_Randomisierte in-situ Studie P11-4 bei Erosion.pdf;Abstract DGKFO Bremen_Randomisierte in-situ Studie P11-4 bei Erosion;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;http://www.drks.de//drks_web/navigate.do?navigationId=trial.HTML&TRIAL_ID=DRKS00012248;2019-03-21T13:47:11.923+01:00;;Marburg;FALSE;

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of LC n-3 PUFA are only partially known. It has been shown that many physiological effects of LC n-3 PUFA trace back to their oxidized metabolites (oxylipins) involved as lipid mediators in a variety of biological processes such as inflammation, pain and blood clotting. Apart from the formation by non-enzymatic autoxidation oxylipins are depending on the substrate, formed especially by enzymatic conversion. LC n-3 PUFA such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) compete with arachidonic acid (AA) for the same enzymes to form oxylipins, whereby LC n-3 PUFA, for example, modulate the immune response and inflammation. <br/>The enormous group of oxylipins comprises several thousand metabolites. The group of hydroxy-, epoxy- and dihydroxy-fatty acids is  underexplored.<br/>Therefore, a study on short-term metabolism (over 72 hours) from LC PUFA to oxylipines, especially hydroxy-, epoxy- and dihydroxy-fatty acids (FA) should be performed.

This study is aiming to evaluate whether training is effective to reduce falls in independently living adults aged 70-80. The particular interest of this study is to investigate whether this training should consist of single tasks (in this case strength training) or dual tasks (in this case balance- and coordination exercises). To assess the effect, fear of falling, cognitive performance and different parameters of gait (i.e. step length) will be measured. <br/><br/>;Dual Task (DT) training is a well-accepted modality in fall prevention for elderly adults. We conducted a randomized controlled trial of task managing training on gait performance in single task (ST), DT, and a control group (CG) that did not train. A total of 78 elderly (72.0 + 4.9 yrs) participated in this study. DT performed task managing training with balance and coordination tasks while ST performed resistance training only. Training consisted of 12 sessions, 60 min each for 12 weeks. We assessed the effects of ST and DT training on walking performance under ST and DT conditions in independent living elderly adults. ST and DT walking (visual verbal Stroop task) were measured utilizing a treadmill at a walking speed of 4.4 ±1 km.h-1.

Current evidence suggests that  these processes can essentially contribute to the progression of age-dependent vascular impairment and lead to neurodegeneration. The magnitude and duration of the postprandial responses are influenced by the amount and type of macronutrients consumed and also by different minor components of the consumed food like antioxidative compounds. Moreover, current human intervention studies show that also physical activity / exercise (especially endurance exercise) has an impact on postprandial metabolic responses and even acute training sessions seem to have beneficial effects. In this context, especially postprandial hyperlipemia seems to be attenuated, whereby the effect size depends e.g. on the intensity of the training session. The aim of the proposed study is to systematically investigate the acute effects of a postprandial, moderate walking program (30 minutes), compared to a postprandial resting phase (30 minutes), on postprandial metabolic events in elderly men and women with a risk phenotype for cardiovascular diseases. The effects will be examined after the consumption of two differently composed meals. The postprandial study will be conducted in a randomized crossover design. Study variables are parameters of lipid and glucose metabolism and biomarkers of endothelial function, inflammation and oxidation. All parameters will be measured at fasting and postprandial state. ;Recruiting complete, follow-up complete;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;http://www.drks.de//drks_web/navigate.do?navigationId=trial.HTML&TRIAL_ID=DRKS00012409;2019-08-14T17:04:10.183+02:00;;Bonn;FALSE;

Due to their high chemical reactivity, free radicals can lead to oxidative damage or modification of cellular components including DNA, lipids and proteins. The effect of chronic oxidative stress is well documented in the literature. Furthermore, evidence suggests that an excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is associated with various chronic diseases including cancer or neurological and cardiovascular diseases. Although ROS are involved in the occurrence of harmful biological events, a moderate ROS concentration is thought to be essential for optimal cell function and signal transduction. <br/>Recent studies have demonstrated that intensive exercise can negatively influence cellular redox status by inducing oxidative stress. The level of free radical production seems dependent on the exercise intensity. In training control of resistance training, the applied intensity is generally considered as one of the most important variables. In order to address muscle hypertrophy, the American College of Sports Medicine recommends using a training load of 70 – 85% of each individual’s one repetition maximum (1RM), whereas lower intensities rarely produce substantial increases in muscle cross-sectional area. However, for clinical populations (e.g. postoperative patients) using such heavy loads is often contraindicated. Consequently, training modalities that promote muscle growth without applying near-maximum intensities need to be identified. Occlusion training, which combines low-intensity resistance training (20 – 40% 1RM) with partial vascular occlusion, might be a promising alternative. Previous research on this topic indicates that this new training method results in similar hypertrophy compared to high-intensity training with 80% 1RM. Since the effectiveness of occlusion training is well documented future research needs to consider the potential safety issues associated with blood flow restriction (BFR) training in inducing hypertrophy in healthy populations. <br/>Although it has been reported that biomarkers of oxidative stress increase after ischemia/reperfusion, the influence of BFR training on exercise-induced free radical production has not been well investigated. Furthermore, previous studies in this area have only used indirect methods and the results are partly controversial. Thus, the main objective of this study was to examine the acute effects of BFR exercise on the exercise-induced ROS generation in whole blood on a local and systemic level in young and healthy adults. Mitochondrial ROS production shall be observed by the addition of inhibitors of the electron transport chain complex III. <br/>To compare the effects of BFR training with other established training methods, a low-intensity resistance training with blood flow restriction (LIBR) was compared with a low-intensity training with normal blood flow (LI) and a high-intensity program (HI). In order to control the influence of exercise, an additional session without exercise but blood flow restriction only (BR) was carried out. An excessive ROS generation after these sessions could potentially be harmful with respect to chronic diseases, whereas low and moderate concentrations may contribute to muscular growth and optimal cell signaling. <br/>;Recruiting complete, follow-up complete;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;http://www.drks.de//drks_web/navigate.do?navigationId=trial.HTML&TRIAL_ID=DRKS00012439;2018-11-16T13:06:47.941+01:00;;Freiburg;FALSE;

Previous studies have shown mindfulness-based interventions to be effective in reducing stress, depression and anxiety in clinical and non-clinical populations. Mindfulness can be successfully taught via internet-based interventions, a promising new prevention and treatment approach with the potential of addressing students that cannot be reached otherwise. This trial aims to evaluate the efficacy and acceptance of a guided internet-based intervention designed to enhance mindfulness in college students (Studicare-M) as well as examine potential moderators and mediators of change on an exploratory level.<br/>Methods: In this two-armed randomized controlled trial, Studicare-M will be compared to a waiting list control group. Studicare-M is based on Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) and consists of 5 weekly guided modules. College students will be recruited in Germany, Austria and Switzerland using the established recruitment strategy of the StudiCare-Project. Recruitment will be proceeded via the internet as well as via recruitment channels on-site universities from Mai to July 2017. This will enable a sample size of n=120. Assessment will take place before and 6 weeks after randomization. The primary outcome is mindfulness (Freiburg Mindfulness Inventory- short version, FMI). Secondary outcomes are stress, depression, quality of life as well as intervention satisfaction, adherence and acceptance. Among examined moderators and mediators are personality traits, treatment expectancy, previous experience with mindfulness and sociodemographic variables.<br/>Discussion: The results will contribute to the evidence-base for internet-based mindfulness interventions in an international and diverse student sample and will provide important information concerning the acceptance and adherence of internet-based interventions in the college student population. Additionally, findings on potential moderators and mediators will provide preliminary evidence for the question “for whom does it work” as well as how to optimize treatment efficiency.<br/>;Recruiting complete, follow-up complete;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;http://www.drks.de//drks_web/navigate.do?navigationId=trial.HTML&TRIAL_ID=DRKS00012559;2017-12-01T09:32:35.344+01:00;;Ulm;FALSE;

Incentives for participation are the individualized feedback on the fitness test results as well as participation in a prize draw.<br/>Follow-up assessment: One week after the baseline assessment and manipulation participants are asked to report their past 7-day physical activity once more (secondary outcome).

The aim is to investigate the extent to which the positive or negative formulation of the items in the self-efficacy questionnaire has an influence on the intention to be physically active and actual physical activity 7 days later. According to the socio-emotional selectivity theory by Laura Carstensen, negatively formulated statements should have a rather negative and positively formulated statement a rather positive effect on the motivation to be physically active - but only in older, not in younger people (since only older adults selectively perceive positive information according to this theory).<br/>In order to investigate this hypothesis, adults of all age groups are approached at events taking place at the Freie Universität Berlin and the Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin (both in Berlin, Germany) in summer 2017. Potential participants give informed consent to take part in the study before filling in the questionnaire, which shows the positive or negative version of the self-efficacy questionnaire at random on laptops/ tablets. The questionnaire is baseline assessment (also assesses age, subjective age, sex, education, weight, height, past 7-day physical activity, intention to be physically active (primary outcome), comprehensibility of the self-efficacy items, satisfaction with life, depressive symptoms) and manipulation at the same time (different versions of the self-efficacy questionnaire). After completion of the questionnaire, participants can participate in optional fitness tests with feedback and take part in a prize draw. One week after this initial assessment and manipulation, participants are invited to self-report their physical activity once more (secondary outcome). The study aims to recruit 400 adults of a broad age range.<br/>;Empirical research shows that self-efficacy is an important predictor for physical activity (Warner & French, in print). Self-efficacy is the conviction that a goal can be achieved despite difficulties and is a core concept of the social cognitive theory by Bandura (1986). Thus, physical activity can be increased more effectively in interventions if behavioral changes techniques are included that stimulated self-efficacy (Williams & French, 2011). There is also evidence that the importance of self-efficacy increases with age (e.g., Schwarzer & Renner, 2000). One way to promote physical activity in the elderly is to provide them with written information that stimulates activity-related self-efficacy.<br/>However, not all health-related information is equally effective. The positive or negative formulation of health information leads to different decisions and health-related behaviors, this effect is known as message framing (Akl et al., 2011). That the formulation of information on health promotion can have an effect on physical activity was shown by Notthoff and Carstensen (2014). In two studies, the authors demonstrated that information on the benefits of exercise promoted it more effectively in older people than information on the possible risks of low-level movement.<br/>We are not aware of studies in the current literature on how this positivity effect affects self-efficacy for physical activity. Therefore, we want to use the empirical evidence on self-efficacy, physical activity and message framing in order to gain new insights for the promotion of health behaviors. The results of the study will be relevant to design information and intervention programs to increase physical activity in the elderly more effectively and thus ultimately reduce the morbidity and mortality rates of certain diseases. A rewording of the questionnaire for self-efficacy is very simple and takes little time, which is why it would be a cost-effective and easy to implement intervention method.;Recruiting complete, follow-up complete;Paper;[---]*;https://doi.org/10.1123/japa.2019-0059;Popp, J., Notthoff, N., & Warner, L.

The ability to differentiate distinct pathological pattern of disturbed breathing (obstructive, central, and mixed apneas) by the new sound sensor is subject of investigation. <br/><br/>Therefore, diagnosed patients with sleep apnea will spend one night in the sleep lab. During that stay, the occurrence of breathing cessations during sleep will be recorded with the new sensors. By parallel recording of breathing cessations by a reference method, a statistical evaluation of the sound sensor's performance will become available.<br/><br/>It is expected that in the future the use of this lightweight and stressless sensor will increase the accuracy of sleep apnea diagnostic.;In patients suffering from sleep related breathing disorders the recording nasal airflow, oxygen saturation, snoring, and respiratory effort is needed for quantification and differentiation of the disease. For respiratory effort monitoring the Respiratory Inductance Plethysmography (RIP) performed by special elastic belts worn at the thorax and abdomen is an accepted method based on current guidelines of the American Association of Sleep Medicine (AASM). It allows differentiation of different apnea types although results could lead to misclassifications under different circumstances, e.g. due to movement artefacts and high Body Mass Index.  <br/>The aim of this study is to investigate a new suprasternal sound sensor of the polygraphic device CID-102 (Cidelec, Saint Gemme sur Loire, Frankreich) and its ability to differentiate distinct apnea types during sleep.<br/>In patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) a recording of sleep (polysomnography) including RIP measurement will be performed in a sleep lab.

Aim of this study was to compare the results   after open flap debridement (OFD) and guided tissue regeneration (GTR) with the use of a bioabsorbable barrier (Guidor) therapy of infrabony defects. 16 patients with 44 infrabony defects were included and assigned randomly to OFD (21) or GTR (23) after conventional scaling and root planing. 21 defects. Following parameters were evaluated: periodontal probing depth (PPD), clinical attachment level (CAL) and recessions 3, 6 and 12 months after periodontal surgery. During surgery the distance of from bone level to the cement-enamel-junction (CEG), the depth and the width of the defect were evaluated. Statistical analysis after 12 month showed a significant reduction of PPD and a significant gain of CAL in both groups. The study failed to show statistically significant attachment gain differences between both groups after 12 months. Analog results were found 120 months after periodontal surgery (Nickles et al. 2010).<br/><br/>The objective of the present randomized controlled clinical trial was (1) to assess and (2) to compare clinical results 20 years after OFD and GTR therapy using a bioabsorbable barrier.

These patients can only completely empty their bladders using a bladder catheter. Since the bladder level can not be readily determined, the emptying is performed according to a fixed time schedule (eg every four hours). This may cause the bladder to be emptied prematurely and thus unnecessarily or even too late, resulting in damage to the urogenital tract.<br/>A research focus of the Chair for Medical Information Technology (MedIT) at the Helmholtz Institute for Biomedical Technology at the RWTH Aachen University is the development of a device which allows a largely load-free and continuous measurement of the bladder level and indicates the optimum time for bladder emptying.<br/>The so-called bioimpedance tomography / spectroscopy offers great potential for realizing this functionality. Bioimpedance spectroscopy (BIS) is based on the fact that the electrical properties of human tissue differ according to tissue type and measurement frequency. Blood and muscles have a good conductivity, while bones and fat are very poorly conductive. For example, if e.g. Due to loss of fluid the body composition, the overall conductivity of a body also changes, and the bioimpedance of the body increases. On the other hand, there is a decrease in bioimpedance with increased accumulation of fluid.<br/>Within the scope of this study, the electrical resistance of the human body is measured at different bladder levels. For this purpose, a harmless alternating current in the frequency range from 5 kHz to 1 MHz is fed into the body with the aid of 16 electrodes and the resulting voltage is measured. The spatial allocation is based on the measured data.<br/>The aim of this study is to determine the arrangement of the adhesive electrodes with which the bladder volume can be measured most accurately. Various arrangements are tested in healthy and adult volunteers.;"Subject of the Bladder EIT study within the framework of the BMBF-funded project ""UroWatch"" is the development of a device for the continuous determination of the bladder volume. The target groups are, on the one hand, persons with a neuropathic bladder-memory-emptying disorder (BSES), which must regularly catheterize or catheterize themselves at defined times, since a determination of the bladder volume is not really possible (Guttmann and Frankel, 1966) ). A further group that can benefit from the development of the device for the measurement of bladder volume are patients with an idiopathic overactive bladder (OAB), which can be effectively supported in their micturition and behavioral training (Ouslander 2004).";Recruiting complete, follow-up complete;Approval of ethics comm.

An important condition for a safe and successful implementation of the measure is an adequate visualization of the glottis and the surrounding structures. Generally this is done by using a laryngoscope under direct supervision on the glottis. However, sometimes the narrow mouth opening as well as the small size of the newborn, even for experienced personnel, occasionally leads to difficulties in visualizing anatomical structures.<br/><br/>In contrast to direct laryngoscopy (DL), videolaryngoscopy (VL) does not establish direct visual axis towards the glottis. The anatomical structures are captured by a camera lens attached to the tip of the laryngoscope spatula and are displayed on an external screen by means of a fiber optic installed inside the device. The use of a videolaryngoscope also allows monitoring and guidance of the procedure by a physician experienced in the intubation of newborns. This could possibly facilitate the training of less experienced personnel and increase the safety of the intubation procedure for the patient.<br/><br/>The aim of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of video-laryngoscopy compared to direct laryngoscopy in a newborn training model.;Recruiting complete, follow-up complete;Approval of ethics comm.

Even in scheduled surgery of incidental findings, severe complications occur in up to 10% of cases. Major neurological deficits, such as paralysis, are important factors that have a major impact on treatment and recovery.<br/><br/>Primary Purpose:<br/>Impairment of cerebral blood flow can lead to an insufficient oxygen supply of brain tissue. By continuous monitoring of neurological functions (“neuromonitoring”) and cerebral microcirculation, disturbances of cerebral blood flow can be detected during surgery. A novel, non-invasive combined laser-Doppler flowmetry and tissue-spectrophotometry technique could therefore predict potential blood flow impairment, which initiates specific therapy in the operating room reducing or preventing neurological deficits (“early warning system”). Additionally, the impact of accepted therapies on cerebral blood flow, oxygenation and metabolism is tested.<br/><br/>Study Participants<br/>Patients undergoing scheduled intracranial surgery (group 1) or emergency surgery within 72 hours (group 2).<br/><br/>;Background:<br/>Although neurosurgical procedures are considered safe, severe complications (i.e. cerebral ischemia, brain edema, intracranial hemorrhage, cerebral vasospasm) occurs in up to 10 %. In an emergency setting, the complication rate increases to up to 60%. Complications during surgery cause neurological deficits that require long-time care. Mechanisms that are causing damage to brain tissue are a) reduced cerebral blood flow, b) cerebral vasospasm and associated hypoxemia, and c) brain edema caused by an increased intra- or extracellular fluid accumulation, leading to a raised intracranial pressure. Here, we propose that changes in parameters of continuous neuromonitoring predict early changes of neurological complications. In this study, we will investigate the applicability of a novel non-invasive optic system used for intraoperative vascular neuromonitoring in neurosurgical patients. Furthermore, the findings will be compared to somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP) for the estimation of cerebral hypoperfusion – an established neuromonitoring technique.<br/><br/>Aims:<br/>This observational study examines the intra- and extracranial application of a novel, non-invasive combined laser-Doppler flowmetry and tissue-spectrophotometry system in patients undergoing scheduled surgery (group 1) and emergency surgery (group 2) in cases with an expected high rate of life-threatening neurosurgical diseases (e.g. cerebral aneurysm, intracranial hemorrhage, cerebral ischemia). This device quantifies capillary-venous oxygen saturation, relative hemoglobin amount, blood cell velocity, and blood flow. These parameters will be correlated with the patient´s functional neurological outcome after surgery and during follow-up. We will thus test if non-invasive vascular neuromonitoring can be used for intraoperative risk stratification system to detect pathological changes in microcirculation as early as possible.

A standardized concept consideres individual needs of the participants.<br/>Compared to adults, children are at a threefold higher risk to suffer from medication errors. This goes along with a high potential for serious impairment. About out 3% of adverse drug reactions (ADR) result in patients’ hospitalization. Especially anticonvulsive medications are frequently responsible for clinical relevant ADR. One third of identified medication errors occur in the process of drug handling. Since dosage forms that are appropriate for children are frequently not available, caregivers have to manipulate the medication for dosing adjustments or to facilitate the administration.<br/>To encounter this issue, we perform an interventional study considering inpatient and outpatient care. We test a concept involving a multidisciplinary team to support children, adolescents and their parents. By doing so, we aim at reducing potentially harmful and avoidable medication errors in the drug handling process.<br/>;Recruiting complete, follow-up complete;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;http://www.drks.de//drks_web/navigate.do?navigationId=trial.HTML&TRIAL_ID=DRKS00013081;2017-11-16T09:59:45.833+01:00;;Leipzig;FALSE;

Following application of the gastric tube, the contents of the stomach (fluids or air) were withdrawn with a syringe and their quantities were noted separately. <br/>A PEEP of 3 mbar prevailed from the start of mechanical ventilation. Data collection starts after application of the gastric tube at a PEEP of 3 mbar (T0). Immediately after T0 PEEP was increased to 5 mbar for 5 minutes.

In the project part of the filling volume of the heart-lung-machine will be replaced at the beginning of surgery with the patient's own blood. This method is called retrograde autologous priming. The reduced fill volume is collected in a RAP bag connected to the heart-lung-machine. The intension of the study is to reduce the negative effects of the heart-lung- machine such as inflammatory response, blood thinning, blood clotting disorders and blood transfusions.;The project will require the replacement of part of the crystalloid cardiopulmonary priming solution in patients with coronary artery disease or aortic valve disease undergoing open heart surgery using the cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) machine at the beginning of surgery with the patient's own blood, both retrograde and antegrade flow direction via the venous and arterial cannula done. This procedure is known as Retrograde Autologous Priming (RAP). The reduced crystalloid filling volume of the perfusion circuit leads to a lower intraoperative hemodilution of the patient and allows the retention of higher hematocrit values during the operation. Since the intraoperative hematocrit value acts as a trigger for homologous blood transfusion, the RAP technique should increase the safety of cardiopulmonary bypass with extracorporeal circulation and reduce the associated costs, both the direct cost of blood transfusions and the cost of treatment for the associated side effects. The newly introduced RAP bag (Terumo) was developed for the above-mentioned RAP procedure in conjunction with a conventional CPB system with the intention to reduce negative effects such as inflammatory response, hemolysis, hemodilution, blood clotting disorders and post-operative complications. The RAP study is a prospective, monocentric, randomized clinical trial designed to assess the safety and efficacy of the RAP procedure and the suitability of the CE certified TERUMO RAP bag.;Recruiting complete, follow-up complete;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;http://www.drks.de//drks_web/navigate.do?navigationId=trial.HTML&TRIAL_ID=DRKS00013512;2017-12-04T09:20:26.634+01:00;;Halle;FALSE;
