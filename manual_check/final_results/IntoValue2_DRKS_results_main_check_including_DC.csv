Then the surgery starts with the surgical drape screen up. The Misgav-Ladach technique is used to open the abdomen. The Operation Theatre is warmed and the lights are dimmed, also the staff is pleased to stay relatively quiet during the operation.<br/>Phase 2:  Shortly before the uterine incision patients are again asked if they are in agreement to continue with the procedure. After the uterotomy, the surgeon lifts the head of the baby out of the uterus. Then the surgical drape is lowered. It is also possible to lower the screen before the lifting out of the head. This procedure will only be performed if no complications occurred during the operation and this remains an individual decision by the surgeon. In the event of unexpected complications like heavy bleeding or problems with the lift out of the babies head the surgical drape will not be lowered. During the antenatal counselling patients were informed in detail about the steps of the procedure.<br/>The principle is then to slowly “walk” the baby out. This step should be visible for the parents. It is also possible for the patient try to “actively push”. In contrast to the classical rapid removal of the newborn, this technique allows pressure from the uterus and other tissues to expel lung liquid. There is no need to actively take out the baby. The trunk of the newborn compresses the uterotomy. Hence a view into the opened abdomen for the mother and father or partner is not possible. Afterwards, the umbilical cord is clamped. Now the father or partner receives a pair of sterile scissors from the surgeon and then cuts the umbilical cord. The newborn is then examined by the surgeon and not by the midwife or neonatologist for fetal well being. If this is adequate, the newborn will be directly taken onto the naked skin of the mother’s breast. The baby is covered by a warm towel and is constantly observed by the midwife. The child will be monitored according the Apgar score. Phase 3: After giving the baby to the mother the uterus in manually checked for residual tissues. Then routine closure of uterus and abdominal wall.",Arm 2,Conventional CS.

Moodbuster (platform hosted by INESC Porto, Portugal) will be used in Germany, the Netherlands, France, Poland and England. Its platform is the interface that participants will use the Internet based CBT content – consisting of five modules – to get information on depression or work on therapeutic exercises (e.g. list of pleasant activities, ideas on problem solving). These exercises are only part of the treatment not of the data assessment for evaluation. Patients will also rate their mood, sleep and activities on a smartphone App to supervise their own treatment progress. All content that participants add to the platform or the App will only be read by their therapist. For every finished module participants receive one to two feedback e-mails from their therapist. <br/><br/>Therapists:<br/>Therapists plan and lead the face-to-face sessions according to the bCBT manual. They schedule meetings and online-feedback e-mails, control the treatment progress of the patients and write feedback. They support their patients also between the sessions in case of unexpected problems. Every message will be send via the contact option (SSL secured connection) on the Moodbuster website. Therapists have to document everything carefully, abide to data security and professional secrecy obligations and have to write a treatment report to the general practitioner if so wished by the patient. Therapists are psychologist in advanced training to become psychological psychotherapists under constantly supervision from experts. <br/><br/>Content:<br/>The core components of the bCBT treatment are (1) psycho-education, (2) cognitive restructuring, (3) behavioural activation, and (4) relapse prevention. Additionally there is content on problem solving and  physical activation. <br/><br/>Duration:<br/>There are ten online sessions (including 10 online-feedback e-mails) with one session per week and five face-to-face sessions every two weeks. There is also an additional technical introduction in a face-to-face meeting with the therapist. The bCBT will go for a period of ten to thirteen weeks.

Patients receiving TAU will also complete ecological momentary assessments (EMA) at the same time points as the patients randomised to blended care.

For the most part, the communication takes place via telephone.<br/> <br/>The intervention aims at positively influencing the symptoms of depression by the care manager’s proactive support of the treatment provided by the GP. This support comprises patient education, behavioral activation, and the introduction of relapse prevention and problem solving techniques (as needed). The continuous monitoring of the symptoms allows for an individual adaptation of the intervention according to a model of stepped care.<br/> <br/>Moreover, a psychiatrist or psychotherapist as part of the study team serves as a supervising specialist. GP, care manager, and supervising psychiatrist/ psychotherapist form the IMPACT intervention team and communicate with each other on a regular basis.<br/><br/>In order to continuously monitor the depressive symptoms and to adapt the treatment where indicated, the care manager assesses the patients’ score on the  PHQ-9 questionnaire via interview on a regular basis. This assessment is independent of the assessments of the primary and secondary outcome carried out by members of the data management team (baseline, 6 months, 12 months).<br/> <br/>Every 8 weeks, the therapeutic outcome is evaluated by the IMPACT intervention team. In case of no or only partial response (< 50% reduction in the PHQ-9 score), the treatment is adapted following an algorithm of stepped care (e.g., change of drug type or dose, or combination of medication and problem solving techniques).<br/><br/>All patients (intervention and control group) can be referred to a specialist as needed (according to national clinical practice guidelines).

For patients in the intervention group, the APNpain will apply the first session of the cancer pain self-management support intervention in the hospital.

The intervention will consist of a face-to-face session during the inpatient stay and phone-calls and face-to-face contacts according to the patient’s further treatment schedule. Provision of information and skill building will be provided mainly during the first session while the nurse coaching component will be provided mainly after discharge. Patients will be followed-up until the pain situation has reached a stable state according to a clinical algorithm triggered by pain intensity, satisfaction with pain management and adherence with analgesic medication and recommendations.<br/>The intervention will be designed to provide structured and tailored components closely based on the German PRO-SELF© Plus PCP. Structured intervention components include an initial assessment of the patient’s pain, side effects and experiences with pain management. Furthermore, all participants will be trained to monitor their pain, other symptoms and analgesic intake, to use a weekly pillbox, as well as to use a script to communicate with clinicians if pain control is inadequate and changes are needed in the analgesic prescription.

Exclusion criteria are present restorations, tooth fractures, exceeding level of tooth destruction, very small caries expansion and asymmetrical caries spreading. <br/>The aim of the study is to examine the sealing ability of adhesives applied to carious and sound dentin of deciduous teeth. <br/>First, the teeth are cleaned from soft tissue remnants and debris. If necessary, enamel and non-carious superficial dentin is removed in order to expose the carious lesion and to create a flat dentin surface. <br/>Two grooves perpendicular to each other are cut into the tooth surface so that the caries is divided symmetrically and four areas emerge. <br/>In one half of each primary tooth sound primary dentin is generated and in the other half leather-hard carious dentin using the combined criteria of visual examination and surface hardness with a dental explorer.<br/>The allocation in which tooth half caries is completely excavated and in which tooth half leather-hard carious dentin remains is done randomly by coin toss. <br/>Adhesives included in this study are divided into five groups: group A = Optibond FL (Kerr, Orange, CA, USA), group B = Prime&Bond NT (Dentsply, Konstanz, Germany), group C = Clearfil SE Bond (Kuraray Medical, Osaka, Japan), group D = Xeno Select in self-etch mode (Dentsply De Trey, Konstanz, Germany) and group E = Xeno Select in etch-and-rinse mode. <br/>Since paired comparisons of adhesives are made, 20 different possible combinations of adhesives can be rendered. All adhesive combinations are randomly assigned to deciduous teeth using a random number generator (Microsoft Excel 2010, Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA, USA). <br/>Adhesives are applied to the teeth so that each adhesive covers one area of leather-hard carious dentin and one area of sound deciduous dentin.<br/>In summary, all deciduous teeth are processed in a way that four different areas occur. For example area 1 = group A on carious dentin; area 2 = group A on sound dentin; area 3 = group B on carious dentin; area 4 = group B on sound dentin.<br/>Dyract (shade A2, Dentsply, Konstanz, Germany) serves as restorative material. The application of the adhesive systems as well as the restorative material is according to manufacturer’s instruction. <br/>On the same day the deciduous teeth are sectioned perpendicular to the bonding surface into two slabs in order to depict the bonding surface of all four areas of the primary teeth. <br/>Afterwards, the cut surfaces of the slabs are polished, etched with phosphoric acid and immersed in sodium hypochlorite solution, in order to improve the exposure of the bonding surface.<br/>Then, impressions of the cut surfaces are taken and epoxy resin replicas are produced by casting the impressions. Thereafter, the replicas are gold sputtered and the resin-dentin interfaces are observed using scanning electron microscopy (= SEM). <br/>The entire interface between the restorative material and the primary dentin of all slabs is perceived by SEM and evaluated using school grades: grade A (= continuous, complete transition between the filling material and dentin) to grade F (= loss of the filling material, so that the dentin is left without any sealing). Thereby, the evaluation of the tightness of the sealing occurs investigator blinded. <br/>The length of the division of each grade is marked on SEM-images. Subsequently, the lengths of these divisions are measured. Thereafter, the percentage of each grade is calculated, based on the total distance of an area of a deciduous tooth. Therefrom, the average grade of an area of a primary tooth is determined. <br/>These average grades are summarized again, so that two average grades per group are generated: One GPA is generated for carious primary dentin and one GPA is generated for sound primary dentin.

The treatment intensification is stratified according to the age of the patient. The induction therapy consists of all-trans-retinoic acid (Vesanoid®) 45 mg/m²/day and simultaneous chemotherapy with TAD. The second induction cycle, HAM with high dose cytarabine (ara-C) is scheduled at day 21 after the start of TAD, independent of the recovery of peripheral blood counts. In elderly patients aged over 60 years the second induction cycle (HAM with reduced ara-C-dose) is at the discretion of the treating physician.

We included children aged between 1 and 12 years old, who were scheduled for an elective inguinal hernia repair or circumcision, with general anaesthesia using a laryngeal mask.<br/>Pressure-controlled ventilation was carried out with a target tidal volume of 6 to 8 ml per kilogram body weight and a PEEP of 3 mbar. The inspiratory oxygen fraction (FiO2) was reduced from 80% to 50%, aiming at an oxygen saturation of above 95% and an end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO2) concentration of 33-39 mmHg. A balanced anaesthesia was maintained to the end of the surgery, using sevofluran with a minimal alveolar concentration (MAC) of 0.8, or as a total intravenous anaesthesia using propofol.<br/>In addition, each patient also received a correctly dimensioned gastric tube through the drainage canal immediately after positioning of the laryngeal mask had been placed with negative leak test. Following application of the gastric tube, the contents of the stomach (fluids or air) were withdrawn with a syringe and their quantities were noted separately. <br/>A PEEP of 3 mbar prevailed from the start of mechanical ventilation. Data collection starts after application of the gastric tube at a PEEP of 3 mbar (T0). Immediately after T0 PEEP was increased to 5 mbar for 5 minutes. After that, additional data collection was done (T1). Thereafter PEEP was reduced to 3 mbar. After a further 5 minutes, the end of a PEEP of 3 mbar was reached in the form of measuring point T2. Finally, PEEP was reduced to 0 mbar for 5 minutes following data collection (T3). General anaesthesia was continued for the remaining operating time in accordance with the current standards in paediatric anaesthesia. The laryngeal mask was removed correctly at the end of surgery once the patient was awake and exhibiting sufficient spontaneous respiration and an adequate presence of protective reflexes. The patient was then handed over to the team in the recovery room. <br/>",,,,,Primary Sponsor,Universitätsmedizin MannheimKlinik für Anästhesie und operative Intensivmedizin,Tim,Viergutz,Contact for Scientific Queries,Universitätsmedizin MannheimKlinik für Anästhesie und operative Intensivmedizin,Tim,Viergutz,71,"Recruiting complete, follow-up complete",yes,Monocenter trial,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During the “pain provocation technique”, children will be instructed to focus on their pain intensity and modulate their pain intensity in their Imagination. Adolescents try to increase their pain intensity (measured via the numeric rating scale, NRS 0-10) by focussing pain at the main pain location and perceive interoceptive sensations at the main pain location. The increase of pain intensity is graduated.  The PPT is conceptualized as a strategy incorporating interoceptive exposure and pain coping strategies.
