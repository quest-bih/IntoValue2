# IntoValue 2 Scripts

This repository contains the scripts accompanying the IntoValue2 publication (...). The final, clean dataset generated during the two studies IntoValue 1 + 2 can also be found under https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5141343.

## Description

The repository is structured into three blocks

 * code: contains all the code files
    - 1_sample_generation: scripts involved in creating the trial samples
    - 2_dataset_cleaning: scripts involved in cleaning and combining the data to the final dataset after the manual publication search
    - 3_results analysis: scripts used to create the plots, tables and analyses used in the publication 
    - 4_shiny_app: code & data necessary to run the Shiny app https://s-quest.bihealth.org/intovalue/
 * data: data files used & generated by the scripts
    - 1_sample_generation: contains the search terms used to identify UMC trials as well as the generated samples
    - 2_dataset_cleaning: contains the results of the manual publication search, intermediate files used in the data cleaning process and the final dataset including readme and data dictionary
 * output: contains the output figures & tables generated by the analysis scripts from the final dataset that were used in the publication
 
The AACT dataset (https://aact.ctti-clinicaltrials.org/pipe_files) is necessary for some of the scripts for the sample generation and the dataset cleaning. As we cannot provide them here, they have to be downloaded from their website before some of the scripts can be used.
