# IntoValue 2 Scripts

This repository contains the scripts accompanying the IntoValue2 publication (https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.05.21261624). The final, clean dataset generated during the two studies IntoValue 1 + 2 can also be found under https://zenodo.org/record/7633995. This Zenodo deposit also contains a zip file of the raw registry data used in both studies. 

## Description

The repository is structured into three blocks

* code: contains all the code files
   - 0_get_registry_data.R: script used to download and unzip raw registry data from Zenodo.
      - NOTE: If code-based download fails, please manually download the raw data:
